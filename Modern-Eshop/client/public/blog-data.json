It was a 32-year-old, 1,856 sq. ft. house in need of a new roof, some remodeling, and major energy-efficiency upgrades including new windows. The massive supply chain and labor shortages at that time made the HVAC portion a much bigger challenge than it should have been. The impediments were plentiful during our mission to have net-zero annual energy costs for our daily living and transportation needs, but by winter #4 here, we got there.\n\nThe list of considerations below should be helpful in making your heat pump ambitions a reality by advancing your understanding of what living in an all-electric, forced-air heated and cooled home is actually like. There are so many things to look out for, but once you know them, your odds of successfully achieving comfort are greatly improved.\n\nEditor's note - this winter in Connecticut has featured many record-setting single-digit Fahrenheit days and nights so far, and I'm writing this in the midst of our second big snowstorm this winter. I'm electric snowblowing frequently to barely keep on top of this 2\" to 3\" of wet snow per hour. Breaks consist of warming up, drying off, and recharging my Ego batteries in my comfy heat-pump-heated, battery-backed-up home. In times like this, I'm glad I've taken great efforts to reduce the chances of frozen pipes and flooding, even if I'm not home, and even if the internet goes down.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackstory\n\nTinkerTry's List of Heat Pump Considerations\n\nSpecify a Cold Weather Heat Pump\n\nDuctwork & Retrofit Challenges\n\nDuctwork Location\n\nInstaller & Contractor Realities\n\nNoise & Comfort\n\nDefrost Cycles & Resistive Heat\n\nSizing, Efficiency & Humidity\n\nEquipment Lifespan & Replacement\n\nOutdoor Unit Considerations\n\nCold Weather Comfort & Staging\n\nRefrigerants & Future-Proofing\n\nSystem Tuning & Optimization\n\nHome Envelope & Insulation\n\nEnergy Use & Cost Realities\n\nCost Breakdown & Payback\n\nHeat Pump Water Heaters\n\nRegional Observations\n\nPolicy, Grid & the Bigger Picture\n\nData & Monitoring\n\nOther\n\nVideo\n\nAbout the Author\n\nFollow\n\nSee also at TinkerTry\n\nBackstory\n\nWe were transforming the home from a gas-fired hydronic heating system with baseboard water heat, over to all-electric. It was a daunting task — our contractor had just three weeks before we moved in to get it right, and there was no going back. The plan was to rip out all baseboards and all natural gas lines, and even the gas meter. By the way, \"natural gas\" is methane, aka dino gas, and part of the goal was to stop burning stuff for \n\nI've learned a lot through acting as both project planner and project manager for this electrification process, and I learned a whole lot more living with heat pump-based heating and cooling in the four winters since making the switch away from burning stuff.\n\nThis article is intended to be a list of things to be aware of, things I wish I knew about back in the summer of 2022 when our offer on the house was accepted, with planning for the September 15 closing and October 1st move-in really began. This necessitated a speedy search for the best options and long-term economic viability for going all-electric in our New England climate. Back then, web searches for this kind of real-world information turned up nothing — it was crickets — and the few articles or videos I could find would have maybe a handful of considerations, tips, and gotchas at most.\n\nThis article hopefully remedies that, and these firsthand learnings are most applicable to others in cold climates looking to do the same sort of renovation. It will be particularly relevant if you have objectives similar to ours, which were:\n\nNon-proprietary thermostats in each room that needed individual temperature control (we went with 5 Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premiums)\n\nGood efficiency, especially in the coldest of winter cold spells\n\nGood comfort, with ceiling ducts that allowed much more flexibility with furniture placement than baseboards ever did\n\nForced air that would allow proper humidification and dehumidification — we were tired of filling and maintaining console humidifiers every day in the winter\n\nProper \"stuffy-ness\" mitigation - an Energy Recover Ventilator for air that feels fresh and is fresh (and filtered) all year long\n\nFor us, the Bosch IDS 2.0 system was the best (and only viable and available) option at the time. How bad were things? A Mitsubishi heat pump was on a 10-month order backlog. Since 2022, a lot has changed for the better as far as cold weather heat pump technology. For example, newer Bosch system designed for even colder climates is the IDS Ultra - Inverter Ducted Split Cold Climate Heat ",

      "body": "This article summarizes my 2025, both professionally and personally. Please consider leaving a comment with feedback, or just to let me know you're interested in learning more about my installation and configuration of some of these tech items.\n\nWith a ton of household-renovation-related work to focus on from 2022 to 2024, all but the most critical tech and home automation acquisitions had to be back-burnered. I needed to patiently wait for some spare time, and a budget. With many aging tech things starting to break in 2025, it turned out to be the year for some major overhauls, including some rip-and-replace and some net new.\n\nJANUARY\n\nMy 2025 began with leaning in to using AI more and more when trying to solve thorny HVAC woes that were mostly related to a rather poor installation done during 2022 when skills and labor were both in short supply. To extend my skills beyond what I'd normally be able to tackle, Perplexity became my technical advisor. Home Assistant Green was another friend of mine, tying all my HVAC components together in novel ways, and supplementing or improving the heating, cooling, humidification, dehumidification, and ventilation of my all-electric home.\n\nThings got especially rough during a January cold snap. I was doing a lot of HVAC ductwork reworking in the attic. During that process, I needed to get some tips on the tuning and wiring of my poorly installed yet new heat pump system. I was fighting off frostbite during some 15 hour days up there. During one stretch of 6 full days of attic work in a row, I was using Perplexity on iOS a whole lot. The goal was to keep the house and its occupants reasonably comfortable during this major re-do of the ductwork, without undue discomfort for the occupants below. Admittedly, I did have a phone-a-friend when absolutely necessary, with a family member in the HVAC business, but he wasn't always available.\n\nBy February, this labor-intensive surgical replacement was successful. I reduced the ducts to about 1/3 of their original length for much better efficiency and comfort. I also replaced the basic HZ432 TrueZONE zone dampers with reputable and reliable EWC Controls UZC4 (Universal Zone Control) controllers from SupplyHouse, along with much better transformer that can handle years of attic heat.\n\nFinally, after much frustration troubleshooting and discovery of sometimes up to 3 splices on brand new runs of improper 6/3 thermostat wiring buried under R40 insulation I had installed, I decided the only right move was to rip-and-replace all of the hundreds of feet of old and new but all unlabeled wiring. Any 6/3 wiring was also limiting my Bosch IDS 2.0 system's multi-stage control abilities. I carefully labelled each of the direct runs of new, proper 18/10 thermostat wire to each of my 7 ecobee Smart Thermostat Premiums, then meticulously sealed up every top plate hole that various contractors had left wide open. No more splices waiting to become future points of failure in our \"forever\" home, renovated to help us age in-place with grace, with less to go wrong, with better comfort and healthy, filtered air.\n\nIn the process of all this arduous but necessary manual labor, I easily saved my wife and I many tens of thousands of dollars. I'm glad I was available to tackle much of this work myself, doing far better work than any of the many contractors who rushed things back when we renovated and moved in September of 2022. I was waiting for my new job's start date in February anyway.\n\nAnother benefit was that there are no longer any HVAC mysteries to me. I now have a good understanding of every aspect of the entire HVAC system, no matter which future contractor helps me with any more serious repairs such as refrigerant leaks or recharges. It's all clearly labeled and easily understood by any professional.\n\nTroubleshooting will be easier too. This helps me sleep better at night. In the end, it was quite gratifying to learn new things that any reasonably skilled DIYer can do better than pretty much any rushed contractor. All the better for me to get in better shape while doing months of attic gymnastics. We can now feel the tangible benefits of my efforts every day, all year long, hopefully for decades to come.\n\nFEBRUARY to MARCH\n\nI started a new chapter—in my long and varied IT career—working full time at Travelers in nearby Hartford. I quickly found I have much to learn from the talented group of elite IT professionals I'm working with. We work on some thorny problems together as a team. Coming into this role from the vendor world, I greatly appreciate that they welcomed me in. I was quite relieved to be equipped with a solid and speedy ThinkPad, featuring the TrackPoint that I've been using for nearly 3 decades. It is also my first AMD CPU system ever, and it wouldn't be my last in 2025. Read on.\n\nAPRIL\n\nI gave up waiting for a viable successor to the Intel Xeon D-1500 series that could be suited for home lab use. It's not happening, especially since I",

Have a listen here, it's generated by NotebookLM. Freaks me about a bit, how about you? Please feel free to leave your comments about this \"podcast\" or anything else about this article right at the bottom, no login required!\n\nIf you don't care to log in to your Google account to hear it, here's a shorter clip below:\n\n \nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nVideos\n\nAlternatively, you can autoplay the entire playlist.\n\nWhile the Rivian R2 was a no-show, I got a good look at the R3 by the best person to explain that lovely interior!\n\nOriginal Article Below\n\nIt's time I try something new. Between jobs is an excellent time for stretching beyond the comfort zones of the many IT-related conferences I usually attend like VMworld. The last time I truly ventured out beyond the world of IT was when I took vacation days to attend CES in 2012. I had a press badge there too, and that sure was a lot of fun. Attending this event sounds fun and even more purposeful to me.\n\nDisclosure: This is not a sponsored post, and all travel costs for this trip are at my own expense. I was provided a press pass for all 3 days at no charge, but there were no stipulations about what I would do while there or the content I create.\n\nHome Energy\n\nI'm excited to announce that I'm going to Vancouver, Canada, from Friday, September 6, to Sunday, September 8, to examine the future of sustainability technology. It's great timing for me, and it's been a relief to finally see a growing portion of the world's population realize that moving away from relying on fossil fuels is the logical path forward, especially as climate change begins to affect them personally.\n\nOther geopolitical issues come into play when it comes to energy, things we have no control over. Or do we? Here in Connecticut, our electric rates temporarily doubled recently, which sure was a wake-up call to my wife and I. So we took action and did something about it. Over the past few years, I'm seeing more and more IT folks I know personally taking similar actions. Meeting non-IT folks who are of similar mindsets at this event will undoubtedly be good for me, and the excitement I feel for this event reminds me of my glory days at VMware, talking to others about VMware & vSAN all over the US.\n\nThe transition toward finding ways to use much less energy to move around and get things made is happening. With each passing year, our grid is generally moving toward carbon-free ways of generating power. Naturally, the sources includes wind, solar, and battery storage systems. Climate change is becoming more evident to more people. We can do better with both transportation and manufacturing, and that transition is largely what this conference is all about.\n\nThis transition happening in both the production of energy and the new uses for it is huge, and not without its challenges. It touches so many industries. Sustainability technologies, or more specifically, all that goes into the process of the electrification of everything, is the area of technology that I've been focusing more of my time on lately, reflected in my content here at TinkerTry. I'm also testing VPP (Virtual Power Plant) and connected solution incentives, and following various V2H/V2G (Vehicle to Home, Vehicle to Grid) technologies.\n\n \nWhat better place to go to meet a wide variety of companies that are in the sustainability space. I know I'm going to have a really good time talking to the various exhibitors from all over the world.\n\nI've been tinkering with my new Virtual Power Plant all summer long with my new, fully operational 27.6 kW solar and 54 kWh energy storage system at home. Topics like Vehicle to Grid, Vehicle to Home, and charge on solar all interest me greatly. I've also been closely following the challenges associated with AC and DC charging of EVs of all brands, as a guy who has Supercharged 182 times at 80 different locations in the US and Canada, and with family living in both Boston and New York City. Those 105 to 115 mile trips each way stretch my range in winter, or even in the summer if I use tires with higher rolling resistance, so the tracking of the real-world use of EVs & charging is very personal to me.\n\nThe Fully charged Show has long touted the #StopBurningStuff hashtag, and that's exactly what my wife and I did when we moved to our forever home 2 years ago, ditching \"natural\" gas and going all-electric, with the solar and battery storage aspects of this renovation featured in this >1M video that Matt Ferrell kindly produced earlier this year.\n\nElectric Vehicles\n\nAfter 30 years of mostly Honda Civics in our household, my wife and I went all EV, getting our Tesla Model 3 EVs back in 2018 and 2019. This decision turned out to be financially wise long-term, especially when I look back at how much business and personal travel",

AWS S3 Standard is expensive, but I can use S3 Intelligent Tiering to automatically move infrequently accessed objects to cheaper storage… so while the first 6 months will cost more, this is going to be a decade-long backup solution. Based on what I&#8217;ve seen so far… my estimated prices will end up being…\n\nS3 Archive Access Storage 301GB x $0.0036/mo = $1.08\nS3 Infrequent Access Storage 152GB x $0.0125/mo = $1.90 \nS3 Frequent Access Storage 82GB x $0.023/mo = $1.87\nS3 Standard (Object Overhead) 9GB x $0.023/mo = $0.21\nIntelligent Tiering Automation Fee = 400,000 x $0.0000025 = $1\n\nTotal monthly cost = $6.08.\n\nIf I ever had to restore, I estimate the egress fees would be about $45. …not horrible for something I&#8217;ll need to do rarely. Likely, never.\n\nS3 Deep Archive\n\nAnother way to drop the cost further is to allow the objects to lifecycle into S3 Glacier Deep Archive, which would bring it down to $5.27.\n\nFor me, a 48-hour delay is acceptable. If I&#8217;m restoring from S3 we&#8217;re in a catastrophic scenario (e.g. fire, multiple drive failure, or Borg invasion) where I&#8217;d have to order new hardware to restore to anyway. We&#8217;re still looking at the same egress fees because restoring Deep Archive files is free when using Intelligent Tiering.\n\nAWS S3 Bucket Setup\n\nTo set this up in AWS, create an S3 bucket like normal. Since PBS is not capable of uploading to the Intelligent-Tiering storage class, create a lifecycle rule to transition all objects to Intelligent-Tiering on Day 1. I also setup a 7-day period to version objects after they&#8217;re deleted.\n\nThen setup the archive configuration (optional). I set mine to transition to Archive Access Tier after 90 days, and Deep Archive Access tier after 180-days.\n\nIf you should ever need to restore, Proxmox is not expecting items to be in Deep Archive, so it&#8217;s best to restore them first which you can do with s3cmd&#8211;the thaw should be free since these objects were put into deep archive by intelligent-tiering.\n\ns3cmd restore --recursive --restore-priority=bulk s3://yourpvebackupstor/\n\nAfter 48 hours the files can all be restored.\n\nProxmox Backup Server Setup\n\nAdd an S3 Endpoint, us endpoint format:\n\n{{bucket}}.s3.{{region}}.amazonaws.com\n\nAdd an S3 Datastore\n\nSelect the &#8220;AWS PBS Backup&#8221; Datastore (I called it s3-aws in the screenshot below), and add a Sync Pull Job. Select your local Proxmox Backup datastore &#8220;pbsbackup&#8221; to S3. \n\nI should note, that this is still a tech preview. So use at your own risk. However, most of the issues I&#8217;ve read about seem to be related to an earlier release of PBS, or not using a tier 1 cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc. One provider in particular that I think would be good for this use case is Google Cloud. Their Archive tier is $0.0012/GB. It&#8217;s a little more expensive than Azure and AWS&#8217;s $0.00099, but with Google, restores from their archive class are instantaneous.\n\nProxmox Backup Server is the best open-source VM backup solution I&#8217;ve used. It is a robust and comprehensive solution, but easy to setup. Having an S3 target as a datastore makes the solution even simpler.\n\nThe post Proxmox Backup Strategy | to S3 appeared first on b3n.org.",

      "body": "I was sitting in the living room, working on the computer. I heard a dog barking out front that sounded just like Blaze. But I knew it wasn&#8217;t Blaze because he was in the backyard with Kris. Then I heard a woman out front who sounded just like Kris. But I knew it wasn&#8217;t Kris, because she was out back with Blaze. A few moments later Kris came in the front door holding Blaze by the collar.\n\nIt was at that exact moment I realized fixing the gate was a higher priority than whatever I was doing on the computer.\n\nThe problem is frost heave 🔻\n\nWater freezes underground and expands as it turns into ice and pushes the posts up. This over time loosens the gate so it doesn&#8217;t always stay latched. Then our dogs escape. We have had a lot of thaw/freeze cycles this year. 2025 is the worst winter I&#8217;ve ever seen for frost-heave. It is time to build a new gate.\n\nI could replace what I have&#8211;wood posts in concrete. But my goal is to build a frost-heave resistant gate. A lot of people say wood posts in concrete is best. But I think concrete isn&#8217;t that heavy compared to the volume it takes, so it&#8217;s easy for ice to push up. I think my gate failed at thirty years old which is ridiculous. I want the new gate to outlast me. So, I built a gate on steel posts using a design from SWI Fence out of Wyoming. It uses driven postmaster steel posts instead of wood posts in concrete. My hypothesis is a steel post is going to weigh more than concrete in terms of lbs per square inch. Steel should be smooth and have a low cross-section so the ice will slip right past it during frost-heave. This is all in theory… I&#8217;ll have to wait thirty-one years to find out.\n\n🪏 The first thing I did was I called 811 before I dug. The city, electric & gas company, and three telecom companies came out. They sprayed a few lines where the utilities were. I&#8217;m glad the city marked the water meter location. I might have driven a post right through it.\n\nA good post driver for steel posts is the Titan PGD3200XPM. But I did not buy that one because it&#8217;s expensive. So I bought a cheaper Titan PGD3875 which is almost a good steel post driver. It didn&#8217;t work at all. The steel posts were too wide for the collar by a fraction of an inch (despite the specifications&#8211;I think postmaster/lifetime increased the width). But at least I had fun driving small steel posts in the ground unrelated to this project! But if you have a 34 pound manual pole pounder and a teenage son like Eli to help, it&#8217;s a lot cheaper, and works almost as well as a Titan PGD3200XPM, while building character.\n\nTroutdale, Oregon. Where FedEx packages go to die.\n\nI couldn&#8217;t find anyone local selling Postmaster posts&#8211;and it was only economical to ship in large quantities. So I ordered Lifetime steel posts. Unfortunately they were sent via FedEx. Whenever something comes FedEx I hope that it doesn&#8217;t get routed through Troutdale. Sure enough, 2 of the 8 posts got routed through Troutdale. They are still stuck there to this very day. Good thing I only need 4 to do a gate on one side of the house. So I started on the side with the latching issue.\n\nAfter pulling up the old posts using a Farm Jack. I followed SWI Fence&#8217;s Cedar Gate design in this video:\n\nWe drove 4 steel posts into the ground using the manual post driver. Then built the fence and gate in-place and cut it loose using a reciprocating saw. We did move the gate forward a few feet because there were big holes where the old gate used to be.\n\nList of tools and supplies (from Amazon, Home Depot, and Lowes):\n\nCraftsman V20 Power Tool Set (Reciprocating Saw, Circular Saw, Impact Driver, and Drill)\n\nCraftsman v20 Compound Miter Saw (cutting 2x4s and trimming pickets)\n\nCraftsman Impact Bits (to drive screws)\n\nCraftsman Level Beam (making sure posts and pickets are level)\n\nCraftsman Measuring Tape (measure things)\n\nGrip Rite 1 5/8&#8243; Stainless Screws (stainless steel won&#8217;t stain the cedar)\n\nGrip Rite 2 1/2&#8243; Stainless Screws \n\nEverbilt Gate Latch & Hinge Kit (heaviest affordable hinge/latch I could find at a good price)\n\nCraftsman Carpenter Square (angling the cross-brace)\n\nAqara Matter Sensor (to notify me if gate is left open)\n\n6&#8242; Cedar Dog Ear Fence Pickets (Home Depot had a pile of these outside)\n\n9&#8242; Postmaster or Lifetime Steel Posts (drove about 4 ft into the ground, well below the frost line)\n\n34 pound Manual Post Pounder (don&#8217;t get the light ones)\n\n2x4s\n\nCraftsman and DeWalt power tools are both made by Stanley Black & Decker. I standardized on red tools because they&#8217;re a lot cheaper than yellow and almost as good (sometimes identical other than color).\n\nI didn&#8217;t have a nail gun, so we secured everything using stainless steel screws with the impact driver. This is probably better than nails anyway.\n\nIt turned out pretty good.\n\nI added a Matter sensor so we&#8217;ll know when the gate is left open. I&#8217;ve bee",

      "body": "After years of watching Ziply install Fiber all over North Idaho and being on the waiting list, Ziply Fiber (referral link) called. Fiber is available at my house. I already have 1Gbps symmetrical with Ting, but Ziply offers faster, cheaper, and a larger variety of plans. In Sandpoint they offer 100 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 2 Gbps, 5 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and 50 Gbps&#8211;the plans range from $20 to $900/month. Needless to say I got the 50…. just kidding. But I did think about it.\n\nAll plans are symmetrical with no data caps.\n\nI decided to get 5Gbps ($80) because it&#8217;s cheaper than Ting ($89) and probably pretty close to what the UDM SE firewall/router can handle with IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) turned on. Ziply&#8217;s Nutritional label says it is 5568 Mbps down and 5567 Mbps up (I have no idea why those are the numbers). Here&#8217;s the results from the UDM Pro&#8217;s automatic speed tests…\n\nFrom the VMs on my Proxmox server, I couldn&#8217;t get SpeedTest to saturate 5Gbps (using the CLI version), but I was able to do it with iperf3.\n\nGetting Ziply installed was a bit chaotic&#8211;I had the install date moved up, a no-show on the new date, the next day Ziply sent me an email telling me they&#8217;d need to move the date out because they hadn&#8217;t run fiber from the street yet… minutes later someone called to tell me they were at my house right now, I was about to drive home, but I found out they got my address mixed up&#8211;they were installing it for someone else.\n\nFinally, the dogs alerted me to a visitor. Then the doorbell rang. It was a guy wearing a Ziply Fiber hat. But it turned out to be a sales guy trying to sell Ziply Fiber. 🤷‍♂️ Sorry dogs. False alarm.\n\nThe day before my install date, I got an email saying they couldn&#8217;t get a hold of me&#8211;but I had no missed calls. Who knows when the installer will come?\n\n(now, I&#8217;m not sure if this is Ziply&#8217;s problem, lots of people are overworked so it&#8217;s just how things work with most contractors in North Idaho…I have the same sort of scheduling issue when trying to get any work done on the house).\n\nWhen the installer, John, did come (amazingly, on the install date!) it went smoothly&#8211;he said I was the first 5 Gigabit customer he had setup. At first he thought he couldn&#8217;t do the install because there wasn&#8217;t enough fiber from the street to get to my house&#8211;but I told him I wanted it in the garage (where the server rack is), and that&#8217;s right where the fiber came in anyway.\n\nThe Nokia ONT (Optical Network terminal) he installed works for 5Gbps plans and below&#8211;fiber comes in, and RJ45 port goes to your router and negotiates at 1, 2.5, (I&#8217;m assuming it can do 5 but didn&#8217;t try it), and 10 gigabit.\n\nHe got the Ziply side up and I knew how to take it from there.\n\nI already had Ting on port 9 (the 2.5 GbE port), so I put Ziply on Port 10 (10GbE SFP+ port). John said he couldn&#8217;t run Fiber from the ONT device into the SFP+ port of the router (I think that&#8217;s a possibility if you get the more expensive 10 or 50Gbps plan). Ziply runs fiber from the street to the ONT device, then converts that to 10Gbps ethernet. The UDM SE&#8217;s fastest ethernet port is 2.5 gigabit, so I had to get a 10Gtek SFP+ to RJ45 Transceiver (Amazon) to use the SFP+ port.\n\nSince the UDM SE can do dual-WAN, I thought I&#8217;d do some side-by-side comparisons of Ziply (5Gbps) and Ting (1Gbps). This is also very unscientific. I only had one house to test this from so your results may vary. This is not quite apples-to-apples from a speed perspective, but from a cost perspective but they are about the same price. Ziply 5Gbps is $80 12/months (but first month is free) then goes to $105) and Ting is $89/month&#8211;so over 2-years they come out even.\n\nThe UDM SE continuously tracks latency to Microsoft, Google, and Cloudflare. Ziply is a very consistent (little to no jitter) 11ms to Google and Cloudflare and 14-16 to Microsoft. Ting is around 9-11ms to Cloudflare and Google (a bit more jitter) and fairly high latency to Google at 30-35ms. I watched both through various network loads from just a few Kbps to several hundred Mbps and they stayed pretty consistent.\n\n Global Ping ICMP Latency\n\nI&#8217;ve you&#8217;ve never tried Globalping, it&#8217;s a way to benchmark your network using probes all over the world. It&#8217;s one of my favorite tools to test TTFB and load times in different regions for my blog. You can do ping, http, https, http/2, mtr, traceroute, DNS. You can also target certain regions, countries, states, or cities. For this first round I used Globalping&#8217;s http/2 test, this requires negotiating an SSL connection, and downloading a test page so it tests latency and upload speeds all at once. West coast was more or less the same, but we start to see faster routes with Ziply to the midwest and eastern United States. I would expect this since Ziply has their own 400Gbps link between Seattle",

I wrote about the 7 Backup Principals on the MacBook Backup Strategy post and the same applies here.\n\nMy TrueNAS server consists of primarily SMB shares&#8211;videos, documents, files, old computer archives, and a webdav share which I use for DEVONthink (DT).\n\nThe rule of 2…\n\n3-2-1 is popular, 3 copies of your data, 2 different types of storage, and 1 copy offsite. This is a good practice. I think what exactly 2 is refers to ambiguous to a lot of people, so here&#8217;s how I implement it in the cloud era.\n\nTwo Backup Technologies\n\nTrueNAS Scale has several ways to synchronize data to the cloud. With any backup, I think it&#8217;s wise to use two distinct technologies. There are so many scenarios where backups can become corrupted, or you find out the backup program excluded a certain folder.\n\nI once saw an Rsync update introduce a bug which caused files to be moved instead of copied to the target! I was working for a customer of a SaaS provider that updated to this version of rsync… and all of our data (and that of all their other customers!) disappeared. They were able to restore service after a week&#8211;but this made me realize you don&#8217;t want to have some diversification in technologies.\n\nTwo Offsite Destinations\n\nIt&#8217;s also a good idea to backup data to at least two distinct offsite destinations. Last year Google accidentally deleted the cloud account of a Pension fund (Ars) and in another case Scaleway lost object storage (Reddit). Even AWS S3 has lost data (Quora).\n\nYou may think it&#8217;s unlikely that your house would burn down and the cloud provider lose data at the same time. Perhaps it is unlikely&#8211;but if you&#8217;ve ever looked at a string of random numbers or dice rolls you know that improbable events do occur.\n\nTwo Solutions\n\nFor TrueNAS backup solutions&#8211;I use 2.\n\nTrueCloud Sync (Restic). This is new to TrueNAS, but is powered by Restic which has been around awhile, and only works with a StorJ target. \n\nCloud Sync (Rclone). This supports backing up to various cloud providers (such as S3, B2, etc.). You can think of it as the rsync equivalent but supporting object storage.\n\nThere are two other backup methods worth considering that I don&#8217;t currently use:\n\nRsync (Rsync). This supports synchronizing files to an Rsync server. Rsync has been around while and is probably one of the most reliable and tested file synchronization programs.\n\nReplication Tasks (ZFS Replication). Can backup both ZVOL (block storage and datasets). If you are using ZVOL block storage (iSCSI or Virtual Machines on TrueNAS) replication tasks are the best way to back them up. I don&#8217;t currently use block storage so I&#8217;m not concerned about this, but if I did, I&#8217;d use ZFS replication. \n\nCloud Sync to AWS S3 Intelligent Tiering\n\nCloud Sync is a robust synchronization option. It is based on Rclone which has been around awhile and is the de-facto standard for object storage synchronization. Rclone was never meant to be a backup tool, but you can combine Rclone&#8217;s sync with S3 versioning to make a backup solution.\n\nSince all Cloud Sync does is copy/sync files, this method is dead-simple&#8211;there is very little that can go wrong and no database to corrupt.\n\nI backup to AWS S3 &#8211; Intelligent Tiering class. On the TrueNAS side simply set the storage class to &#8220;Intelligent Tiering&#8221;. On AWS &#8211; when creating the bucket I enabled versioning. And I setup an Intelligent Tiering Archive configuration so that after 90 days objects are moved to the Archive Access Tier, and after 180 days they move to Deep Archive. I also setup a Lifecycle Policy to remove non-current versions after 180 days.\n\nWith intelligent tiering, while initially expensive at $23/GB, objects that don&#8217;t change eventually go down to the $0.00099/GB rate when they lifecycle to the S3 Deep Archive tier. Most of the data on our TrueNAS unit doesn&#8217;t change frequently so is charged the Glacier Deep Archive cheaper rate.\n\nObject storage transaction costs can get expensive (both in dollars and time) when you have lots of small files, so try to reduce the number of files. Compress your archive data into zip files to reduce the number of objects.\n\nA few more thoughts & advantages of AWS:\n\nA lot of people try to backup to the nearest AWS region&#8211;I decided to backup to a region far away in the Eastern US&#8211;just on the off-chance there&#8217;s a large geographic disaster. \n\nAlso, my hats off to AWS on performance&#8211;I have also used BackBlaze B2, StorJ, and others&#8211;and AWS outperforms all of them&#8211;it can nearly max out my gigabit connection. If you want fast backups use AWS (I am guessing GCP and Azure would offer the same performance).\n\nAlso, if you have a lot of data and slow internet, one option to upload or restore faster is using AWS Snowball (they will send you physical storage) ",

From top to bottom:\n\nMikrotik CRS504-4XQ-IN\n\nUniFi Switch Aggregation (USW-Aggregation)\n\nTESmart 8X1 KVM\n\n3x Intel NUC11 Extreme:\n\n1x i9-11900KB, 2x i7-11700B\n\n64GB RAM\n\nWD SN770 1TB for NVMe memory tiering\n\nNFS storage presented from my Mac Studio\n\nConnectX-4 dual port 25 GbE NIC\n\n3x MS-A2 \n\n9955HX\n\n96GB RAM\n\nSamsung PM983 1TB for NVMe memory tiering\n\nSN850X for vSAN ESA\n\nConnectX-4 dual port 25 GbE NIC\n\nUSW Enterprise 8 PoE\n\nPiKVM \n\nAll powered using Tapo P304M so I can monitor power consumption, and remote start up/shut down the lab\n\nHere&#8217;s a diagram of how it&#8217;s all connected together. Not in the diagram is a UniFi NAS which presents NFS for Content Library, as well as acting as a backup target for the VCF Fleet, plus Veeam backups. The NAS is not in the rack, and is connected to my home network elsewhere in the house.\n\nThe link to my main network comes into the Aggregation switch, which then connects to a USW Flex XG in my office for personal devices (and a Mac Studio, more on that below). The Aggregation switch also has a downlink to the USW Enterprise 8 PoE which powers the CRS504, connects to the PiKVM, and acts as a quick access switch.\n\nFrom the Mikrotik itself, I have 4x QSFP to SFP28 breakout cables connecting to all the hosts, plus 2 bonded to the Aggregation switch (2x 10 Gbps) leaving two spare SFP28 tails. I do plan on replacing the USW Flex XG, the Aggregation, and the PoE switch with a single unit at some point to tidy things up further. This setup gives all the hosts 2x25Gbps non-blocking bandwidth to each other, and the NUCs get 10 Gbps to the NFS storage and wider network (more on that below).\n\nHost control wise I use a PiKVM, and this can send commands via IP to the TESmart KVM switch to change input. This KVM switch is nice and you can turn off the display, but the method of changing IP is awkward since it comes with a static IP from factory and you need software which only runs on Windows to be able to change it (I&#8217;m a Mac user!). Additionally, I cannot get the TESmart management interface to come up when connected to the PoE switch, yet strangely it works fine from Aggregation using a SFP+ to RJ45 transceiver &#8211; weird! I&#8217;ve tried manual link speed etc with no luck. If you have any suggestions please leave a comment.\n\nVCF wise, the 3x Minisforums hosts form my VCF 9 Management Fleet/domain. I then have a VCF 9 WLD on two of the NUC hosts using NFS storage. This storage is presented from my Mac Studio with a OWC Express 4M2 USB4 Enclosure housing some NVMe drives. I use the Mac Studio for photo/video editing; due to its low power consumption I don&#8217;t turn it off, so I also use it as a Plex Media Server plus a 30+ container Orbstack suite. Within this suite is Authentik which I use for SSO/2FA, halverneus/static-file-server which I use for VCF Offline Depot, and I figured I could make use of it for NFS based storage for VCF too. The final NUC runs vSphere 8 and acts as a &#8216;legacy&#8217; vSphere deployment, which is used mainly for HCX lab work connecting into the VCF 9 WLD &#8211; mainly because you cannot live migrate between AMD and Intel.\n\nIf you&#8217;d like me to do a deeper dive into the VCF side of things, please let me know in the comments. Or any comments in general, I try and reply to everything and I welcome your interaction. There&#8217;s no right or wrong way to do homelabs, just design something with your own budget and requirements in mind. If it wasn&#8217;t for the current hardware prices I&#8217;d ideally run 6x MS-A2&#8217;s so I make the most of what I acquired before that &#8216;AI&#8217; thing happened.\n\nThanks for reading.",

To keep things as fair as I can, all hosts are using dual 10 GbE interfaces, and the nested VCF VMs will be deployed onto the same Datastore where no other VMs are running. The storage is a Synology iSCSI LUN, using 4x 4TB SATA SSDs in Raid 5. All devices are connected via a UniFi Aggregation Pro switch.\n\nJust to point out, I had to enable NVMe memory tiering on all devices to support the VCF deployment due to its heavy RAM requirements.\n\nThe VCF deployment is the following spec, using VCF 5.2 GA:\n\n$NestedESXiMGMTvCPU = &#8220;8&#8221;\n$NestedESXiMGMTvMEM = &#8220;64&#8221; #GB\n$NestedESXiMGMTCachingvDisk = &#8220;4&#8221; #GB\n$NestedESXiMGMTCapacityvDisk = &#8220;500&#8221; #GB\n$NestedESXiMGMTBootDisk = &#8220;32&#8221; #GB\n\nTimes:\n\nSingle Xeon W-1290 workstation:\nPowerCLI run time &#8211; 7 minutes and 14 seconds\nCloud Builder time &#8211; 1 hour, 40 minutes, and 55 seconds\nTotal time – 1 hour, 48 minutes, and 9 seconds\n\nSingle NUC11 Extreme:\nPowerCLI run time &#8211; 7 minutes and 9 seconds\nCloud Builder time &#8211; 2 hours, 12 minutes, and 7 seconds\nTotal time – 2 hours, 19 minutes, and 16 seconds\nNote: I had to restart the Cloud Builder tasks a few times due to running out of CPU resources\n\nSingle MS-A2:\nPowerCLI run time – Duration: 7 minutes and 11 seconds\nCloud Builder time – Total time – 1 hour, 28 minutes, and 7 seconds\nTotal time – 1 hour, 36 minutes, and 44 seconds\n\nUsability wise, the nested VCF deployment feels much more responsive than on either of the other two hosts, which is not surprising as it has more cores and the CPU is a much newer generation &#8211; Zen 4 and Zen 5 really are great performers.\n\nHopefully the above shows how capable the Minisforum MS-A2 is.

Invariably, with homelabs you end up having to rebuild some (or all) of it as you experiment, and I found myself in that position. I do intend on writing a blog covering how my lab is set up with VCF 9 <at some point>, but in short I have the following configuration:\n\nVCF Mgmt Domain: 3x Minisforum MS-A2&#8217;s with vSAN ESA\nVI WLD: 3x Intel NUC 11 Extreme&#8217;s with NFS storage\n\nFor whatever reason I needed to rebuild the VI WLD. I figured I&#8217;d initially add 2x hosts, and then work out in the new way of the world how to add a 3rd host. Deploying the VI WLD was simple, and once deployed I ensured that my VCF SSO user (not to be confused with vSphere SSO!) was in the vsphere.local\\administrators group. Then, with vCenter Linking/groups configured, I was able to log into both the Mgmt and the VI WLDs and see the other VC like ELM in VCF 5 and below &#8211; no doubt without the associated offline snapshot ELM headaches I might add!\n\nThe next step is to log into the Management vCenter, right click on the <VI WLD> cluster, and add unassigned host (the third was already commissioned into VCF), but I faced an error message:\n\nThis reminded me a little of days gone by working with Microsoft software where you face an error and it says to speak to the administrator. I am the administrator! I looked at the documentation but couldn&#8217;t see anything definitive, I even tried ChatGPT and Grok for some assistance but given how new VCF 9 is they weren&#8217;t much help.\n\nLooking in hosts under global inventory lists I saw the error:\n\nI then spent a bit of time looking in VCF Operations and ensuring that everything was set up right under Administration > Access Control, but I eventually gave up and logged into SDDC Manager directly to see if I could do it there and I could! Not to be beaten, since Broadcom documentation clearly suggests it can be done in the vSphere UI, I took at look at Single Sign On and saw the vsphere.local\\sddcadmins group. Clearly there is some demarkation in administrative rights regarding what you can do traditionally in vSphere as a VI admin, and SDDC Manager operations &#8211; which makes total sense as we don&#8217;t want all VI admins to be able to do host/cluster level &#8216;stuff&#8217; right?\n\nOnce I added my (VCF) SSO user account to this group, and logging out and in again for good measure, I was finally presented with the add host UI via vSphere.\n\nTL;DR &#8211; it looks like the VCF SSO user needs to be in vsphere.local\\sddcadmins to be able to add a new host.\n\nAdmittedly I need to take a deeper dive into the documentation to see if this is mentioned, but figured this might help someone out.",

Whilst I like the NUCs, I&#8217;ve been wanting to replace the Xeon workstations. They started off in a Dell SFF workstation, but due to heat management issues I removed the CPUs and I&#8217;ve rehoused them into Silverstone Fara R1 cases. They perform well, however they&#8217;re large, and take up a lot of space. I&#8217;ve spent months and months musing over what to replace them with, and I nearly ordered an AMD EPYC CPU and a bunch of RAM from eBay with the intent of buying a 2U case to house it in. Then I saw rather a lot of chatter about the Minisforum MS-A2. I knew of the MS-01, however I didn&#8217;t feel that the CPU in it gave enough grunt for VCF deployments, plus I wanted to avoid the whole P/E core situation, so I discounted it. The MS-A2 however ticks a lot of boxes &#8211; it&#8217;s a small, 16C/32t box with very decent hardware:\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9955HX,16C/32T\n\nDual DDR5-5600Mhz, up to 96GB\n\nM.2 PCIe 4.0 SSD slot*3 | Support U.2 NVMe/M.2 22110\n\nDual 10Gbps SFP+ Lan & 2.5G RJ45 Lan Ports | WIFI 6E & BT 5.3\n\nNote: only one of the two 2.5 GbE interfaces works in ESXi\n\nBuilt-in PCle x16 Slot\n\nReports indicate it will run with 128GB of RAM, however 64GB SODIMM&#8217;s are extremely expensive compared to 48GB (in the UK), so I went with the 96GB option. I went ahead and ordered a pair and I wanted to see how they were for vSphere homelab purposes, with the intent to ultimately run nested VCF using William Lam&#8217;s amazing PowerCLI script for the deployment.\n\nFirst off, ESXi installed without an issue, although you will get a TPM 2 alarm since the on board TPM chip does not support FIFO which is required for ESXi. Best to disable the trusted platform to avoid this alarm.\n\nYou can see I&#8217;ve enabled NVMe memory tiering, using an Samsung PM981 Enterprise drive as the tiering disk for this. As expected, the Realtek 2.5 GbE interface is not picked up, however the Intel 2.5 GbE interface is, as are the two 10 GbE SFP+ interfaces.\n\nI&#8217;ve populated the PCI port with a 25 GbE NIC which is why you can see 5 interfaces in total.\n\nOverall, it&#8217;s running well, and whilst I haven&#8217;t done any benchmarking the VMs I have tested so far do perform very well.\n\nPower consumption wise, bearing in mind I am using a 25 GbE dual port NIC, I am seeing around 55-65W with the host on and ESXi in maintenance mode. vSAN is enabled on the host, and in addition with the PCI NIC power consumption is likely to be higher due to the NIC and vSAN services. Also, 3x NVMe are on each host (boot, cache, vSAN). When I run up a VCF Management domain with 4x nested hosts, the VC, single NSX, Edges, SDDC Manager, LCM etc, it&#8217;s showing around 130W per host and I saw 140W peak. I&#8217;ll run this again without the PCI NIC at some point. Here&#8217;s a graph overview:\n\nUpdate 03/06/25 &#8211; removing the 25 GbE card, power consumption dropped by roughly 10W overall.\n\nNot the longest post but I know what there are people out there interested in the MS-A2 and whether ESXi works on them. The short answer is yes, it works well so far. I&#8217;m going to do a longer blog post with the deployment of VCF on them, that will be published in due course. Spoiler &#8211; nested ESXi does work, albeit with some caveats which I will also cover.\n\nSo far, I&#8217;m very pleased. The power consumption is small for what they are, and the fan noise while audible when running under load is not annoying like it can be with other hardware which has small fans.",

      "body": "I previously blogged about how you can get BGP working between a UDM-SE and NSX Edge. I wanted to revisit the topic as BGP is now built into the UDM itself as of GW firmware 4.1 I believe, and there is no requirement to visit the command line except to troubleshoot and verify. I also wanted to revisit this topic as it looks like in one of the most recent firmware versions UniFi added the kernel flag to enable multipath. Previously this was only possible with a custom kernel using older firmware. At the time of this post I have only tested Active/Standby Edges.\n\nI&#8217;ve recently been deploying with various VCF labs and I also wanted to test Edge Cluster deployment via the SDDC UI, which does require multiple uplinks and ECMP to be working before it will allow you go proceed with Edge Cluster deployment.\n\nFirst of on the UDM side, I have these networks configured for VCF. /24 is pretty wasteful for a small lab but I didn&#8217;t want to confuse things with tighter networks. Gateways are all .1\n\nI&#8217;m using VLAN 104 for the Edge TEP interfaces, VLAN 105 for the first uplink network, and VLAN 106 for the second uplink network. In my frr config I have the following to give the UDM-SE additional interfaces to peer with the Edges:\n\n network 192.168.105.1/32\n network 192.168.106.1/32\n\nOn the Edge side, node 1 has two interfaces:\n192.168.105.11 & 192.168.106.11\n\nNode 2 has two interfaces:\n192.168.105.12 & 192.168.106.12\n\nThese peer with the UDM-SE via iGBP on AS 65001. I&#8217;ll try and get screenshots of the deployment process in SDDC Manager, although I would urge anyone doing this to give the API a try.\n\nHere is my frr config which can be uploaded to the UDM-SE via the UniFi Network Application web interface &#8211; no more CLI required! I have the initial router-id (192.168.51.1) for my main NSX lab where I only use a single uplink as it is for basic testing. There&#8217;s probably better ways to do this, but this is enough for the deployment to succeed and routing to work with the subsequently configured Overlay AVNs.\n\nrouter bgp 65001\n bgp router-id 192.168.51.1\n redistribute connected\n redistribute static\n maximum-paths ibgp 4\n\n neighbor 192.168.51.2 remote-as 65001\n neighbor 192.168.51.2 default-originate\n neighbor 192.168.105.11 remote-as 65001\n neighbor 192.168.105.11 default-originate\n neighbor 192.168.106.12 remote-as 65001\n neighbor 192.168.106.12 default-originate\n neighbor 192.168.105.12 remote-as 65001\n neighbor 192.168.105.12 default-originate\n neighbor 192.168.106.11 remote-as 65001\n neighbor 192.168.106.11 default-originate\n\n network 192.168.105.1/32\n network 192.168.106.1/32\n\naddress-family ipv4\n\n neighbor 192.168.51.2 activate\n neighbor 192.168.51.2 send-community all\n neighbor 192.168.51.2 soft-reconfiguration inbound\n neighbor 192.168.105.11 activate\n neighbor 192.168.105.11 send-community all\n neighbor 192.168.105.11 soft-reconfiguration inbound\n neighbor 192.168.106.12 activate\n neighbor 192.168.106.12 send-community all\n neighbor 192.168.106.12 soft-reconfiguration inbound\n neighbor 192.168.105.12 activate\n neighbor 192.168.105.12 send-community all\n neighbor 192.168.105.12 soft-reconfiguration inbound\n neighbor 192.168.106.11 activate\n neighbor 192.168.106.11 send-community all\n neighbor 192.168.106.11 soft-reconfiguration inbound\n\n bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax\n\nThis works perfectly with VCF and NSX Edges in active/standby. I can deploy Aria VMs on the AVNs, and have full connectivity from my home environment. I can also power down the active edge, and watch the standby come back online. Pretty neat!\n\nHappy labbing.",

      "body": "The VMware vCenter Server Appliance or VCSA for short is by far the easiest method to manage the vSphere environment, including hybrid solutions spanning traditional on-premises, container ready and public cloud deployments. Everything under the same roof (or Software Defined Data Center, better!). With so much going on and different tasks and activities it is important to carefully plan the size of the VCSA appliance from the start. Of course it is possible to fix it later. In the meantime logs can fill up the storage dedicated to the logs. If extending the disk is not an option, possibly the best and quickest one is to remove unwanted stale logs taking valuable space. On a default VCSA deployment the disk for storing logs is automatically set to 10 GB and a warning usually triggers an alert when reaching or going over 75%. Inevitably this brings the VMware Log Disk Exhaustion alert. Now while it does not require immediate action, it is definitely a good idea to take action while there is still a 10%-15% free space on the log disk.\n\nThe procedure to identify and remove the logs is pretty simple and straightforward. It requires SSH access to the VCSA appliance and a few command to list the log size and location to ultimately remove them. It goes without saying before deleting any file, even old logs, it is always a good idea to take a backup or eventually a snapshot and have that peace of mind.\n\nThe entire process is very quick as run by command line. There are 3 main locations where the logs can accumulate in larger sizes:\n\n/storage/log/vmware/sso/tomcat/\n\n/storage/log/vmware/eam/web/\n\n/storage/log/vmware/lookupsvc/tomcat/ (vCenter 7.0 only)\n\nThis article refers to the steps on vCenter 7.0 release.\n\nVMware Log Disk Exhaustion remediation\n\nWhen old logs are exceeding the default size threshold on the VCSA appliance this triggers the VMware Log Disk Exhaustion. This can easily be seen on the Summary page for the SDDC environment.\n\nWhen logging to the vCenter Server Management Appliance, in the Monitor > Disks section it also shows the consumed disk space per volume. Default thresholds can be modified, ideally shouldn&#8217;t be changed to be too close to the maximum size.\n\nNext step is to run a SSH session to the VMware VCSA appliance and login to the BASH Shell with the command shell. The default login shell is called appliancesh and can be changed a more traditional one BASH Shell.\n\nAt this point with a simple &#8220;df -h&#8221; it returns the statistics about the total, consumed and available size on each storage volume or disk as these appear in the VCSA Management appliance. Clearly the &#8220;/storage/log&#8221; is exceeding the default threshold hence the VMware Log Disk Exhaustion trigger alert.\n\nAnother useful command also allows to detect multiple storage disks over a certain threshold, for example 78%.\n\nAs indicated above there are 3 main paths accumulating a large amount of logs. The first one is &#8220;/storage/log/vmware/sso/tomcat&#8221;. In this path it is possible to search for all catalina*log file and remove them with a simple command.\n\nSimilarly, same exercise can be done for &#8220;/storage/log/vmware/eam/web&#8221;. And again remove catalina*log files.\n\nEqually for &#8220;/storage/log/vmware/lookupsvc/tomcat&#8221; can repeat the same process.\n\nSo far only a few files and small ones have been removed. Within same locations there are plenty of other files that can be removed. These can be identified as &#8220;localhost_access*&#8221; in &#8220;/storage/log/vmware/sso/tomcat&#8221;.\n\nEqually in &#8220;/storage/log/vmware/eam/web&#8221;.\n\nAnd also in &#8220;/storage/log/vmware/lookupsvc/tomcat&#8221;.\n\nNow for each one of these paths is possible to remove the unneeded files with a simple &#8220;rm localhost_access* from &#8220;/storage/log/vmware/sso/tomcat&#8221;.\n\nSame for &#8220;/storage/log/vmware/eam/web&#8221;\n\nAnd a final one on &#8220;/storage/log/vmware/lookupsvc/tomcat&#8221;.\n\nNow running the same command as before on the root level it is possible to check the reduced size. This will also reflects in the VCSA Management console after an inventory update or restart of the VCSA if preferred. In this case the space used went from 83% down to 62%.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to list and remove the sps-access*log files from the &#8220;/storage/log/vmware/vmware-sps&#8221; path.\n\nThe command will be executed in a similar fashion.\n\nBut what if more log files should be deleted to reclaim even more space? Within the same &#8220;/storage/log&#8221; it is possible to quickly identify also the paths using more space and order them by size. In this example it shows the biggest 30 folders. Next it is just a matter of identifying the log files again and removing them with a simple command. As always having a backup or even a snapshot before it is always a great option for the peace of mind when not comfortable with the command line.",

      "body": "VMware VCSA SSL mismatch and editing VM properties, what&#8217;s the connection?\n\nPlaying with a homelab is where it is possible to come across different issues that can happen in production environments too. In this particular instance upgrading and reusing (read playing!) with different releases has shown a symptom never seen before. Everything in the VMware VCSA works absolutely fine including the tasks of creating, moving and deleting VMs. But not editing! To be more specific there was this strange behavior where it is possible to create a VM and select specific property values. Once the VM configuration is saved, it is not possible to view / edit the existing values (in this case for the Virtual Disks).\n\nThe post below shows a quick sample of VM properties not in a editable state and how to fix this with the help of a script to run on the VMware vCenter appliance and solve the VCSA SSL mismatch. This script is available for download from the official VMware KB article which includes also additional instructions for other use cases. For this scenario the script is executed to run the &#8220;trustfix&#8221; option which detects and solves the VCSA SSL mismatch with the current names and modules registered in the vSphere domain.\n\nAs a word of caution, it is recommended to take a backup of the VMware VCSA before making any changes. Additionally, taking a snapshot helps too for quick recoveries to a previous state.\n\nFix VMware VCSA SSL mismatch\n\nShould the vCenter show inconsistent information or prevent some VM properties to be edited, it could be related to a VCSA SSL mismatch with certificates. Either not trusted or maybe not registered against different modules in the vSphere environment. For example this can happen during certificate replacements. When this occurs, it might be possible to create a VM and save its configuration. Later some of the properties might not be shown or available for editing. Like in the screenshot below the Virtual Disk properties are unavailable for editing.\n\nWhen this issue occurs, the best option is to download on VMware VCSA appliance the lsdoctor.py script. The script can be uploaded using utilities like WinSCP and why not even the Veeam console for a secure and fast file copy. The option that will be used in this case is &#8220;-t or &#8211;trustfix&#8221;. What this option does is to fix the vSphere SSO and check for any potential VCSA SSL mismatch with registered certificates. Before running the trustfix option it is necessary to generate a report with SSL mismatch findings. And this is where the &#8220;-l or &#8211;lscheck&#8221; option comes into play.\n\nOnce the script has completed (the actual execution time is very short), it generates a report in /var/log/vmware/lsdoctor directory. Each report has a specific timestamp making them easy to use and consume. Hence first step is to run and generate a report with a &#8220;-l&#8221; option. It is important to specify the python binary (installed by default) on the VMware VCSA. Actually more than one version of python are already installed and available on the VMware VCSA appliance.\n\nNext step is to investigate the generated log. It comes in a JSON format and easy to read with builtin text tools like &#8220;cat&#8221; or &#8220;more&#8221; for reading convenience.\n\nIn this example the log shows multiple VCSA SSL mismatch with certificates (actually 47, I use the homelab a lot!) and also the recommended step.\n\nOf course it is possible to fix all entries in the log in one go and simply by rerunning the script with the &#8220;-t&#8221; option this time. It goes without saying, having a working backup or snapshot before proceeding it is more than common sense!\n\nOnce accepted the previous step the script kicks in and runs in no time. This one found and solved 47 VCSA SSL mismatch certificates in one go.\n\nNow that all SSL certificates in the vSphere SSO are working it is a matter of restarting the VCSA appliance or just the services. It might actually work faster due to RAM memory allocation on the VMware Host where the VCSA appliance is running. This is accomplished with a single line:\n\n&#8220;service-control &#8211;stop &#8211;all && service-control &#8211;start &#8211;all&#8221;\n\nA few minutes later and checking back on the VM properties, now all of them are available and editable.\n\nDepending on which method has been used to copy the script on the VMware VCSA appliance, it is important to revert the bash shell options to their default (bash shell vs appliancesh) and help hardening security while accessing the VCSA appliance. More on this in a dedicated article.",

      "body": "In this final part of the article series dedicated to immutability, this article shows the most important bits when it comes down to hardening the security on the linux servers hosting the immutable backups. So how is it possible for bad actors (users and apps) to prevent linux delete immutable files?\n\nPrimarily connectivity and permissions.\n\nFrom a connectivity perspective the first and most obvious is to disable SSH access. Otherwise this could let unauthorised access from unsolicited or compromised accounts. Ideally the servers should be secured in a locked down server room. The only access available is through &#8220;local&#8221; consoles like ILO, iDRAC and similar.\n\nFrom a permissions point of view the least the better. Also the user intended to connect to the linux server should not be part of the sudo group or equivalent. This prevents a compromised user (that can still remotely connect when SSH is left unattended) to run admin commands.\n\nIn the case of Veeam Immutable backups, data is transported using the Data Mover service (veeamtransport). A special and separate service (immunereposvc) is responsible to check and set the immutable bit on the required files (full and incremental backup files) plus the special file .veeam.N.lock which is updated with the immutability time period for each file in the backup chain (Full .vbk &#8211; Incremental .vib)\n\nMoreover, assuming other local accounts gain access to the linux server are not able to list, change or modify any file and folder. This is possible when the ownership and access control for the immutable files location is configured only for the intended account. As long as the permissions remain intact, even the root account will receive the &#8220;Permission denied&#8221; when trying to delete or change any of these files.\n\nThe root account, as special user has the ability to add/remove the &#8220;i&#8221; bit for immutability by mean of the &#8220;chattr&#8221; change attribute command. As soon as the attribute is removed, the files can be deleted from the root user again. So the following is a best practice:\n\nAvoid leaving the SSH service running unattended\n\nOnly use &#8220;local console&#8221; to connect to the linux server\n\nEmploy Single-Use credentials for the user intended to connect to the linux server\n\nDeploy the necessary components\n\nRemove the user from the sudo group (in case SSH is still on)\n\nDisable the SSH service when the install has completed\n\nInstall a 2FA solution for increased security\n\nVeeam Hardened Repositories follow the Sec 17a-4, FINRA 4511 CFTC 1.31 regulations with regards to W.O.R.M storage (Write Once Read Many). Configuring the Hardened Repositories with the principles above ensures the highest level of protection and safeguard of the backup data.",

      "body": "The first article and video in the series were showing the steps about preparing a linux ubuntu machine for a Veeam XFS Repository to serve immutable backups. In this second part the video covers the actual steps of making the linux machine &#8220;Veeam ready&#8221; by adding this one as a Managed Veeam Server. In practical terms what this part does is to make sure the minimum prerequisites are up and running. Essentially the SSH service to install the components and the Perl modules.\n\nIt is important to notice that the SSH is initially required for the first deployment. At a later stage the best practice is to disable this service on this box if not otherwise strictly required. In addition, Veeam has the capability of using a local user with Single-Use credentials. This prevents Veeam to store any credentials in its database and talk to the host machine with server certificates instead. Veeam does not require SSH to communicate with the host server as long as the Veeam components (Data Mover Service) is installed. Communication ports can be customised too.\n\nIn order to install the components via SSH, the Veeam installer will initially connect to the host server via SSH and leverage the following Perl modules:\n\nConstant\n\nCarp\n\nCwd\n\nData::Dumper\n\nEncode\n\nEncode::Alias\n\nEncode::Config\n\nEncode::Encoding\n\nEncode::MIME::Name\n\nExporter\n\nExporter::Heavy\n\nFile::Path\n\nFile::Spec\n\nFile::Spec::Unix\n\nFile::Temp\n\nList::Util\n\nScalar::Util\n\nSOAP::Lite\n\nSocket\n\nStorable\n\nThreads\n\nAt the time of ubuntu 16.04 it was required a manual install of these modules as already covered in a previous article. The great news is the current version of ubuntu 20.04 has all these Perl modules already installed. If for whatever reasons this is not the case or maybe using another distro these are not installed by default it is important to enabled the compatibility of Perl with x86 even if running in a x64 operating system. The video shows how to quickly check the version and location of Perl.\n\nOnce these components are up and running the Veeam wizard to add the ubuntu machine as Veeam Managed Server is very quick and easy to follow. When possible it is highly recommended to use the Single-Use as opposed to the traditional ones. One more thing to consider is that the same linux machine cannot be used as Veeam Repository and also as Backup Proxy. And this is primarily for security reasons where is not possible to mix standard (Data Mover) and hardened (Data Mover) together.\n\nNext step is to add a new Veeam XFS Repository following the usual wizard and choosing the newly created mount point on the newly linux Veeam Managed Server. This process is not different from the usual ones in the Veeam console. It adds the ability to check both data de-duplication and immutability for the desired period. The XFS provides both capabilities and Veeam leverages these without the need of adding any extra layer or adding any appliance. Actually Veeam can run immutable backups on top of any commodity hardware supported by the chosen linux distribution.\n\nLast important steps after creating the new Veeam Hardened Repository is to remove the linux user from the sudo group or equivalent (this prevents bad actors to run admin tasks) and disable the SSH access too (this prevents event the root account to access the linux server). Ideally only a local console (similar to ILO, iDRAC and others) should be able to access the linux server. In addition, for added security and auditing purposes it is recommended to install 2FA app on the linux server which would send a notification in case of remote access to the server.\n\nFinally in the last part of the video the creation of a test backup job storing data on the Veeam Hardened Repository. It will not make any change and/or deletion even to Veeam admin managing the console.",

To a point where some of these specialise in deleting also the backup files along with encrypting the live production data with a custom key. Unfortunately not all victims from ransomware attacks managed to get their data back even after paying for the ransom. Even worsts some of the victims have been hit multiple times. The purpose of this article is to present a quick way to deploy a linux ubuntu setup that can be used to prepare a Veeam Hardened Repository.\n\nVeeam Hardened Repositories provide &#8220;immutable backups&#8221; by mean of W.O.R.M. (Write Once Read Many) approach. In addition, Veeam Hardened Repositories adhere to the FINRA and SEC-17a regulations just using commodity hardware and further expanding on the agnostic approach, which also brings no vendor lock-in.\n\nThe linux ubuntu setup for Veeam immutability consists in running a linux machine with restricted access to the storage where the backups will be stored. On top of that, Veeam also controls the retention period for which these files are set as immutable. During such period the backup files cannot have any change and or deletion. Not even from the Veeam administrator account or the root user. These includes malicious users or applications trying to delete or change the backup file.\n\nThis article series shows 3 steps for the linux ubuntu setup:\n\nCreate linux ubuntu machine in a VMware homelab (this article)\n\nSetup the linux partition or disk with XFS file system\n\nShow what happens when hardening is not done right\n\nThe series also shows the creation of a backup job with Veeam Backup and Replication, how to make data immutable, what happens when data gets deleted during the retention period and finally some practical considerations on how to harden the linux ubuntu setup. It is also worth noting, a similar setup can run on other linux distros. It is always important to check the OS compatibility with the available hardware. In this case the homelab is running on a VMware environment and the disk used to store immutable data is directly attached to the VM as a SCSi disk. Of course it is also possible to present to the linux ubuntu iSCSI disks connected to a SAN.\n\nFor example to check the hardware compatibility this ubuntu page lists the certified hardware with the latest ubuntu 20.04 release. In a similar fashion other linux distros can be used as Veeam Hardened Repositories including but not limited to RedHat, Debian, CentOS, SLES Linux and more. In general the ones with linux kernel 5.4 and later ship with latest version of the XFS, which is essential to provide both the data de-duplication and immutability options.",

      "body": "During re-install of my Cloud Director lab, I noticed that the installation of ovftool (officially named OVF Tool) is not documented. Which seems odd to me, because with 2 variants at hand, it should. In this post I show you how.\n\nIt&#8217;s good to know that ovftool for Linux is not available in some form of distro specific package (deb, rpm etc.) nor via Snap, Flatpack. Therefore ovftool is not found in any repository. The options for Linux are twofold.\n\nA VMware based installer\n\nA ZIP file\n\nFrom a convenience point of view the installer based variant is preferred. If that one does not work for your favorite distro, the ZIP based one is the alternative.\n\nIf you ask yourself what ovftool is, the user guide explains it:\n\nOpen Virtualization Format (OVF) is an industry standard to describe metadata about virtual machine images in XML format. VMware OVF Tool is a command-line utility that helps users import and export OVF packages to and from a wide variety of VMware products.\n\nSource: OVF Tools User Guide\n\nIn my case I often use ovftool to deploy OVF based appliances like Cloud Director in an automated and standardized way. By using this tool, I do not have to to through every tedious deployment step compared to the vSphere Web Client.\n\nI&#8217;ve described the deployment of VMware Cloud Director using ovftool a while ago, which still applies.\n\nDownload OVF Tool\n\nAs of writing the latest version of ovftool is 4.6.2. The downloads can be found here. The top link points to the VMware customer connect site where the installer variants can be found for Windows, Linux and MacOS. All the other links point to the ZIP based variants for the same OS&#8217;es.\n\nPer feedback from Timo Sugliani on X, he mention an installer for ovftool is available via VMware customer connect, which I was not aware of before. The post is updated based on that info. Thanks for the feedback.\n\nOption 1: Ovftool installer\n\nThe top link in the image above points to the installer based variant. An MSI for Windows, a DMG for MacOS and VMware based &#8220;bundle&#8221; installer for 32 a 64bit Linux. OS support for ovftool is documented in the release notes.\n\nInstalling\n\nAfter the Linux installer is downloaded, mark it as executable.\n\nuser@host:~/Downloads$ chmod +x VMware-ovftool-4.6.2-22220919-lin.x86_64.bundles\n\nStart the installation\n\nThe command below starts the GTK based graphical installer, which is frankly the first time I saw this for a VMware product. Interesting…\n\nuser@host:~/Downloads$ sudo ./VMware-ovftool-4.6.2-22220919-lin.x86_64.bundle\n\nLet&#8217;s check is ovftool is available.\n\nuser@host:~$ ovftool --version\nVMware ovftool 4.6.2 (build-22220919)\n\nAgainst may expectations I must say, it worked just fine. No hassle with PATH variables this way. A VMware customer connect account is required to download the bits.\n\nOption 2: Ovftool ZIP\n\nIf for a reason the ovftool installer does not work on your Linux distro, using the ZIP variant should get you started.\n\nExtract ZIP file\n\nIn my Ubuntu system the default download folder for ZIP file is:\n\n/home/user/Downloads\n\nExtract the ZIP file using unzip:\n\nuser@host:~/Downloads$ unzip VMware-ovftool-4.6.2-22220919-lin.x86_64.zip\n\nOvftool is now extracted in the &#8220;ovftool&#8221; subfolder. Next step is to add the folder to the path variable.\n\nModify Path variable\n\nIn Ubuntu Linux the the PATH variable can be extended in multiple way. I choose to go for the most easy way, by modifying the the &#8220;.profile&#8221; file which is located in my home folder &#8220;/home/user&#8220;.\n\nI&#8217;ve added the line below at the bottom of the &#8220;.profile&#8221; file:\n\nPATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/Downloads/ovftool\"\n\nThe last step is to logout and login again to make the changes active. Let&#8217;s check.\n\nuser@host:~$ pwd\n/home/user\nuser@host:~$ ovftool --version\nVMware ovftool 4.6.2 (build-22220919)\nuser@host:~$ \n\nFrom within every folder ovftool can now be used without hassle.\n\nTo conclude\n\nFor my Ubuntu 23.10 based workstation, both variants (installer and ZIP) worked just fine. It&#8217;s strange the documentation does not mention either way of installing ovftool. Kudos to Timo for the hint about the installer variant.\n\nAnyway, have fun automating your work or lab environment.\n\nCheers, Daniel\n\nUseful links\n\nOVF Tool &#8211; Downloads (Installer via Customer Connect)\n\nOVF Tool &#8211; Downloads (ZIP)\n\nOVF Tool &#8211; User Guide\n\nOVF Tool &#8211; Release notes\n\nBlog: Deploy Cloud Director using ovftool",

      "body": "In November 2022, I wrote a post on my endeavor about installing PowerCLI on my Windows box. I needed PowerCLI 13 ImageBuilder feature, which was the only way to add the USB Network Native Driver for ESXi fling to a custom ESXi ISO image.\n\nCheck these posts here:\n\nPowerCLI 13 update and installation hurdles on Windows\n\nCreate ESXi 8 Customized ISO Installer\n\nOver a year has passed and I wanted to do the same on my Ubuntu 23.10 (Mantic Minotaur) based Linux laptop. I quickly found out it&#8217;s the same hassle with little documentation from VMware.\n\nInstalling PowerCLI is the easy part. Configuring it to create ESXi ISO&#8217;s with ImageBuilder is another thing. This post shows you how to install PowerCLI and configure Python and OpenSSL.\n\nRequired software\n\nPowerCLI 13.2.1 (which is the latest at time of writing, released 27 November 2023) requires the following software:\n\nPython 3.7.1 or later, including pip and some additional packages\n\nsix\n\npsutil\n\nlxml\n\npyopenssl\n\nOpenSSL 1.1 or later\n\nPowerShell 7.x\n\n.Net Core 3.1\n\nInstalling prerequisite software\n\nThe important thing here is to install all the required software from the Ubuntu repositories to prevent breaking package dependencies. Make sure to first update your Ubuntu system with the latest updates before going ahead.\n\nInstall Python and related packages\n\nIn my case Python 3.11 was already installed, but not all the additional Python packages. Install them via:\n\nuser@host:~$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-six python3-psutil python3-lxml python3-openssl\n\nDowngrade OpenSSL\n\nAll Ubuntu versions as of 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) are using OpenSSL 3.x packages. ImageBuilder in PowerCLI only supports OpenSSL 1.1.x. If not, an error is thrown which pretty much says that OpenSSL 1.1.x is not installed.\n\nVMware KB 93110: ImageBuilder Error &#8211; &#8220;failing to load VibSign Python module\n\nThe full error message is:\n\nGet-DepotBaseImages: Failed to initialize the VMware.ImageBuilder PowerCLI module because of error: Failed to load VibSign Python module. Make sure OpenSSL 1.1 is installed.\n\nMake sure that Python 3.7.1 or higher is installed and that you have set the path to the Python executable by using Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -PythonPath <executable_path>. See the PowerCLI Compatibility Matrixes for information on the Python requirements.\n\nThe workaround for this is to downgrade the OpenSSL packages to 1.1.x using Ubuntu Focal packages. Secondly the downgraded version need to be holded, so they&#8217;re not upgraded during the next Ubuntu patch cycle.\n\nBe aware that the holded OpenSSL packages are not updated anymore and software that expects OpenSSL 3.x could throw errors.\n\n1: Download old OpenSSL packages\n\nopenssl_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20_amd64.deb\nlibssl-dev_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20_amd64.deb\nlibssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20_amd64.deb\n\n2: Install replace OpenSSL packages\n\nsudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i libssl-dev_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i openssl_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20_amd64.deb\n\n3: Hold OpenSSL packages to prevent updates\n\nsudo apt-mark hold libssl1.1\nsudo apt-mark hold libssl-dev\nsudo apt-mark hold openssl\n\nInstall PowerShell\n\nThere are two ways to install PowerShell on Ubuntu.\n\nOption 1: Via packages\n\nThe first is to use the package based variant as described in the PowerShell documentation.\n\nInstalling PowerShell on Ubuntu\n\nOption 2: Via Snaps\n\nThe second variant is to install PowerShell via Ubuntu App Center and search for PowerShell. This way, PowerShell is installed as a Snap.\n\nEither way works, it&#8217;s up to you.\n\nInstall and configure PowerCLI\n\nThe installation of PowerCLI itself is pretty simple and is described in the documentation.\n\nPowerCLI User&#8217;s Guide &#8211; Install PowerCLI\n\nNow a couple of settings need to be configured in PowerShell.\n\n1: Configure response to untrusted certificates\n\nFor Linux, only the &#8220;Fail&#8221; and &#8220;Ignore&#8221; options are supported as mentioned in the documentation.\n\nPowerCLI User&#8217;s Guide &#8211; Configure the PowerCLI Response to Untrusted Certificates\n\nLet&#8217;s go for &#8220;Fail&#8221; which is the safest option:\n\nuser@host:~$ pwsh\nPowerShell 7.4.0\nPS /home/user> Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Fail\n\n2: Configure Python Path\n\nFirst determine the Python path.\n\nuser@host:~$ which python3\n/usr/bin/python3\n\nSecond configure the Python path and exit PowerShell afterwards.\n\nuser@host:~$ pwsh\nPowerShell 7.4.0\nPS /home/user> Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -PythonPath /usr/bin/python3\n...\nPS /home/user> exit\nuser@host:~$ \n\n3: Get rid of the CEIP message\n\nSet the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) message to &#8220;true&#8221; or &#8220;false&#8221;. Personally I prefer &#8220;false&#8221;.\n\nuser@host:~$ pwsh\nPowerShell 7.4.0\nPS /home/user> Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -ParticipateInCeip $false\n\nUsing ImageBuilder\n\nAll steps are now done to get ImageBuilder working in Ubuntu.

Unfortunately I do not have the exact logs anymore. It showed that vLCM had issues compiling the image baseline related to the Mellanox Connect-X (nmlx5_core) and Intel E810 (icen) ESXi driver \n\nI knew that I&#8217;ve added a couple of async drivers to the vLCM image baseline (using a custom json file) a while ago. That was done to make sure the hosts had the latest NIC drivers and VMware Tools.\n\nAfter deleting both of the ESXi NIC drivers (nmlx5_core and icen) from the vLCM image baseline component list, the flooding of log messages stopped.\n\nFYI: vCenter version 8.0 Update 1, was used while this issue showed.",

Regulations vary by country and will change over time, a lot of these regulations are still pretty new and aren&rsquo;t being enforced yet, but the real motivation should be our moral obligation. The internet, one of the most powerful tools of the modern age, is for everyone, can you imagine being unable to use it?</p>&#xA;<p>Beyond the legal and moral implications, failure to address accessibility can have a financial impact on a business directly. Imagine you&rsquo;re trying to sign up for a service but their website isn&rsquo;t working correctly, how hard would you try to do business with this company before moving on to a competitor? Especially one that has a working website? What would you have to say if someone asked you about this company? This is the perspective of a person effected by inaccessibility.</p>&#xA;<h2 id=&#34;accounting-for-everyone&#34;>Accounting For Everyone</h2>&#xA;<p>We often think of a disability as being unable to see or hear, but these are only a few possible impairments a person could have. Hearing impairments can affect certain frequencies or ranges of frequencies, and visual impairments can affect only specific colors, or specific areas of the visual field, or even certain kinds of motion or flashing lights. We can&rsquo;t simply assume that a person with a visual impairment will use a screen reader and keyboard and completely stop using their monitor and mouse, they may choose to use any combination of those options. In this case, for example, over-use of &ldquo;screen reader only&rdquo; elements can make the site difficult to navigate and confusing for a person that uses both a screen reader and a monitor.</p>&#xA;<p>There are many other kinds of disabilities too, and not all of them permanent. Have you ever had a headache? Or broken a bone? Those are temporary disabilities that could impact how you interact with the internet.</p>&#xA;<p>This is not to say you need to be an expert on disabilities, rather that you should avoid making assumptions or broad generalizations. We cannot predict how any person will interact with a website, we must give them options, and ensure that any chosen combination of those options work together to provide a cohesive experience.</p>&#xA;<h2 id=&#34;the-web-content-accessibility-guidelines&#34;>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h2>&#xA;<p>The <a&#xA; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>&#xA; (or WCAG, for short) is a versioned collection of guidelines for web accessibility. This is an incredibly valuable tool, but it requires some interpretation to use, these are in fact guidelines rather than clear concise rules. At the core of WCAG there are four principles:</p>&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</li>&#xA;<li>User interface components and navigation must be operable.</li>&#xA;<li>Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.</li>&#xA;<li>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;<p>The rest of the guidelines go on to clarify and qualify what each of these principles means in specific contexts and situations. I highly recommend reading the entire thing at least once, but it is more of a reference piece. WCAG won&rsquo;t necessarily tell you how to make",

Today, I want to talk openly about what happened and what I&rsquo;m doing to improve.</p>&#xA;<p>In 2022 I rebuilt this site, leaving behind a bloated Gatsby build for what felt like a fresh and clean Hugo and Webpack system. I wrote five articles in 2022 and another one in 2023, I started two new series that I was pretty excited about, I ran a content poll to inform future topics, and then… Silence. For those of you that were waiting for more content I do apologize, this was a pretty clear failure on my part.</p>&#xA;<h2 id=&#34;what-went-wrong&#34;>What Went Wrong?</h2>&#xA;<p>It&rsquo;s hard to really nail down exactly what went wrong, it was certainly a combination of smaller factors that accumulated to this result. I believe these are the top three contenders.</p>&#xA;<h3 id=&#34;focus-and-purpose&#34;>Focus and Purpose</h3>&#xA;<p>Working full time as a software engineer has been very rewarding, and I think the collaborative growth I&rsquo;ve been a part of at work has been satisfying my desire for social learning and knowledge sharing.</p>&#xA;<p>I think there is a balance to be found here, topics I can write about publicly can also be of value to colleagues, and I don&rsquo;t have to spend all of my free time and effort on topics that are proprietary.</p>&#xA;<h3 id=&#34;motivation-and-feedback-loops&#34;>Motivation and Feedback Loops</h3>&#xA;<p>A lot of you have been very supportive and grateful for the time and effort I put into my articles, and I am extremely grateful for that! But nothing stings like spending hours on an article only to have unconstructive negative feedback. This is a problem many content creators face though, it just is what it is.</p>&#xA;<p>Conversely, the feedback loops at work are instant, and they happen on video calls where people are generally less honest about negative or constructive feedback because they&rsquo;re looking me in the eye. It&rsquo;s easy to lean in to that more because it feels better, but I&rsquo;m missing out on the comments that actually prove me wrong constructively, or challenge my perspectives, that&rsquo;s the feedback that ultimately makes me better at what I do.</p>&#xA;<h3 id=&#34;friction&#34;>Friction</h3>&#xA;<p>I think this was the biggest factor, or at least the one I can most attribute to the 2022 redesign. Markdown is fantastic, hands down, I love it. But, opening up a code editor to write an article after being in a code editor all day for work? That just feels like work to me. For a while I tried writing drafts in a few different places and then copying them over so I could jot down ideas as they came to me or make a little progress on my phone while I was waiting somewhere, but this just added friction.</p>&#xA;<p>Friction is a funny concept, how something so minutely inconvenient can so easily zap your motivation to do a task. It feels lazy to admit, but we all have been dissuaded by friction, and sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to recognize the pattern when it&rsquo;s happening to you.</p>&#xA;<h2 id=&#34;actionable-goals&#34;>Actionable Goals</h2>&#xA;<p>Now that we know what went wrong, we need a plan to get back on track.</p>&#xA;<h3 id=&#34;redesign-2025&#34;>Redesign 2025</h3>&#xA;<p>As you can see, I have a brand new site already, the third iteration of my Hugo and Webpack stack, which I intend to write about in detail for the <a&#xA; href=&#34;https://www.dlford.io/blog/series/hugo-and-webpack/&#34;>Hugo and Webpack series</a>&#xA;. Most importantly, I&rsquo;ve integrated <a&#xA; href=&#34;https://decapcms.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;>Decap CMS</a>&#xA; to remove the friction of writing, and I&rsquo;m leveraging render hooks to reduce the use of shortcodes in my content. I&rsquo;ve also changed the theme quite a bit, and trimmed down on some of the fancier features of the site to keep things simple, improved accessibility, and made the navigation much easier to intuit.</p>&#xA;<h3 id=&#34;planned-content&#34;>Planned Content</h3>&#xA;<p>Armed with the results of the content poll I ran before, I am working on a content schedule that I can leverage to take more friction out of writing; what to write about. I&rsquo;ll have a top-down list populated so I can just start writing about whatever is next on the list without making any decisions.</p>&#xA;<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a strict publishing schedule, and I don&rsquo;t intent to change that, but I will be holding myself accountable to dedicate at l",

The entire scene is to show the relationship between the Webpack bundler and the Hugo static site generator.&#34;&#xA; &#xA; &#xA; width=&#34;600&#34;&#xA; height=&#34;438&#34;&#xA; src=&#34;https://www.dlford.io/media/rss/hugo-webpack-part-2-feature.a57678d61f37c7df4461fd838f5bb8b39177eb157b6d777dffd05ce56601ba03_hu_8f12333985352a9d.png&#34;&#xA;/>&#xA;<p></p><h2 id=&#34;webpack&#34;>Webpack</h2>&#xA;<p>Webpack is a module bundler, we will use it to compile all of the JavaScript for a page into a single module (technically two modules, more on that later). Webpack separates the code based on how it&rsquo;s used, which helps to reduce unused code and speed up page load times because the bundles are smaller, it&rsquo;s also much faster to download one file than all the individual bits that would be used on a page separately. We&rsquo;ll also use Babel to ensure your code will run in browser, this means we can use some newer JavaScript features that haven&rsquo;t made it to the browsers yet, and Babel will transpile that code to make it compatible. Lastly, we will use Webpack for cache-busting in production builds, this way we can set all CSS/JS files to cache forever, when the file changes the filename will also change, so the browser will only download files that have changed since the last visit.</p>&#xA;<p>Here is the GitHub branch for this completed segment:</p>&#xA;<p></p>&#xA; <a class=&#34;title&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/dlford/hugo-webpack-demo/tree/part-2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;>GitHub - dlford/hugo-webpack-demo at part-2</a><p class=&#34;description&#34;>Example repository for my Hugo and Webpack series.

We have <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code> for pages that will use React. We have Babel and a bunch of plugins for it. We have Sass, Autoprefixer, and PostCSS for handling CSS files. Concurrently we&rsquo;ll use to start up Webpack and Hugo at the same time. Lastly, <code>dotenv</code> is used to read <code>.env</code> files for keeping secrets safe.</p>&#xA;<h3 id=&#34;how-webpack-and-hugo-interact&#34;>How Webpack and Hugo Interact</h3>&#xA;<p>Hugo gives each page a &ldquo;Kind&rdquo; and &ldquo;Type&rdquo;, we can use those as generic selectors for CSS and JS files. For example, if kind is &ldquo;page&rdquo; and type is &ldquo;blog&rdquo;, we can create a <code>main.js</code> file in <code>src/kind/page/blog/main.js</code> that will apply to all pages that match the same kind and type.</p>&#xA;<p>We can also get specific and create files such as <code>src/path/sitemap/main.js</code>, which would apply to the <code>/sitemap</code> page.</p>&#xA;<p>The same concepts apply for CSS files, where we can use <code>@import</code> to group re-usable CSS files together.</p>&#xA;<p>In Hugo, we can then inject those bundles into the HTML with link and script tags. In production builds, Webpack will output bundles as files into the <code>assets/generated</code> directory, we will check if the files exist and add them to the HTML conditionally, but in development mode there ",

In addition, the modern Intel i3 series processors are quite powerful. I regularly do software development work on an i3 Chromebook and it keeps up without hesitation.</p>&#xA;<p>Chrome OS is Linux. Severly locked down Linux, yes, but that&rsquo;s what makes it secure. Additionally, &ldquo;Crostini&rdquo;, the un-locked-down Linux container that can be enabled in Chrome OS, is out of beta, and it&rsquo;s very good. You get Debian by default when you enable the Linux container, but you can swap it out for another distribution with relative ease.</p>&#xA;<p>I&rsquo;ve attempted this transition a few times before and while there was a lot to like it wasn&rsquo;t quite ready for prime time, but I&rsquo;m happy to report that all of the issues and gripes I had have been resolved at this point in time.</p>&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>✔ Dark theme</li>&#xA;<li>✔ Linux containers officially supported and reliable</li>&#xA;<li>✔ No more outdated Debian, many modern distributions available</li>&#xA;<li>✔ Reliable and built in backup/restore functionality for Linux container</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;<h2 id=&#34;whats-good&#34;>What&rsquo;s Good?</h2>&#xA;<p>Ease of use. As someone who swore off Windows when it became more buggy than Linux, and swore of Apple when they started selling 3+ year old hardware priced as if it were cutting edge (to Apple&rsquo;s credit, I think they&rsquo;ve stopped that practice, but I&rsquo;m already out the door), it&rsquo;s fantastic to use on OS that just works. I still rock Linux on my desktop machine, but my laptops now sit collecting dust.</p>&#xA;<p>The ecosystem. Is it as good as Apple? I wouldn&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s quite good. My Android phone is well integrated into Chrome OS, and more importantly I can get up and running on a new Chromebook with very little effort.</p>&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Your files are all right where you left them thanks to Google Drive.</li>&#xA;<li>All your Chrome and Android apps, and most of your system settings are backed up automatically (apps pinned to the shelf, WiFi networks, and printers, to name a few), so they will be restored automatically.</li>&#xA;<li>You can easily restore a backup of your Linux container, which includes the entire container and everything that was installed and configured, so everything is just as you left it.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;<p>That last point is amazing, since most of the work I do is in the Linux container, I run monthly backups (both backup and restore can be done in the Chrome OS system settings with the click of a button), and upload them to Google Drive for safe keeping.</p>&#xA;<p>The apps. You have the entire Google Play Store library at your fingertips, and Linux apps! Simply install any Linux app and the launcher will auto-magically show up in the Chrome OS app drawer, you can run it as if it was installed natively on Chrome OS.</p>&#xA;<p>The performance. Chrome OS is lightweight while still having nice aesthetics, the UI has been steadily improving over time, and most models have stellar battery life.</p>&#xA;<h2 id=&#34;things-to-consider&#34;>Things to Consider</h2>&#xA;<p>The obvious big complaint here is software support. This doesn&rsquo;t effect me at all though, since I abandoned Windows long ago, and with it my Adobe and Pro Tools subscriptions. I&rsquo;ve found free and open source alternatives that fill the roles of those apps quite well.</p>&#xA;<p>Disk space and memory. The unfortunate standard for Chromebooks is 4GiB of RAM and 64GiB to 128GiB of disk space (often eMMC, which is basically just a soldered down SD card). On the bright side, there are some models with higher RAM capacity and NVMe SSDs that can be upgraded (the RAM is usually soldered in, so don&rsquo;t count on any upgrades there).</p>&#xA;<p>The hardware is, decent, that&rsquo;s the compromise for the price. But even that has gotten better these days, in the case of my current model the keyboard is actually really good, and the trackpad is flat out fantastic considering it&rsquo;s not even made of glass. My only complaint is the plastic body, but even so it feels plenty sturdy.</p>&#xA;<h2 id=&#34;what-chromebook-am-i-using&#34;>What Chromebook am I using?</h2>&#xA;<p>I am rocking the 2021 Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i, which sports an 11th generation Intel i3 CPU in a very affordable package. The keyboard and trackpad are both very n",

      "body": "This post is about my new to me 2015 Magnum/Generac MLT3060K Light Tower & Generator and how I came to the conclusion to buy it. Its has an 1800RPM Liquid Cooled, Diesel, 1.0L 3 Cylinder engine running at 1800RPM and a 6kw Generator end with a massive 30 gallon fuel tank, capable of running at full load for over 60 hours without refueling built into a convenient trailer, with super bright lights that can extend 30 feet up in the air. I got this unit used for $1200 with just over 5000 hours on the meter. Its generally known that these can often go 20,000 hours before a major service. Its Prime rated, and suitable for continuous operation. \nBe warned, this is kind of a long post!\n\nWhy did I buy a light tower?\n\n2 is 1 and 1 is none!\nIf you read my other posts you know I love Generators, equipment, and other cool things in general, and having an extensive home network and Homelab means I want to keep everything powered on no matter what. Our entire lives revolve around electricity, and a lot of my house relies on automation in Home Assistant, and a lot of my security systems requires power. I live on the Gulf Coast of the USA meaning hurricane and strong storms are a threat to our local power grid. I have a 27kw Liquid cooled 1800rpm Natural Gas generator you can read about in my other posts, but what happens if that breaks, or the natural gas goes out? You can have the best generator in the world, but one small part breaking or the fuel supply going offline, and you&apos;re out of business.\nUntil now my only backup to that unit was a small Tri-Fuel Champion generator. That generator has been good, and worked every time I loaned it out during storms, however its not very tough. Its not something you&apos;d be confident to run for 1 or 2 weeks non stop, in the brutal Houston heat. Unless you run it on natural gas, you&apos;d be filling up the tank 3 or 4 times per day. You&apos;d also need to shut it down and change the oil every 50 hours! That is just not what I&apos;d want to be doing after a hurricane or during any inclement weather. It also means I need to plan to shut down my entire network setup, unless I can get the oil change done in less than 10 mins (UPS Runtime limitations) \n \n\nThe other problem is that unless you put a lot of effort into building a generator shed, you can&apos;t really leave it in a position to be ready to run. I&apos;d need to rush out and remove it from my garage and set it up for use, and find a cover for the power outlets\nThis Light Tower is VERY tough and prime rated. It has extremely long run times, over 60 hours per tank. Refueling is very easy and not nearly as dangerous and you can go up to 1000 hours between oil changes. That&apos;s 41 days of non-stop operation... There is no carb to get gummed up, parts are readily available, diesel is easy to store and I can easily move it to another location because its a trailer. Its also able to be just left out in the weather, as its already in a weatherproof enclosure. Despite the size of this unit, it actually uses significantly LESS fuel than the Champion 100520 I have. Even with the increased price of Diesel, it costs much less to run per day. At current prices, and the same estimate load, it would cost me $45 per day to run on my portable generator in gas, while living life normally. With the light tower, it would cost just $30. For reference, my natural gas unit runs me around $12 a day (Confirmed by 2 recent disasters where we ran over 8 days in total on generator)\nAnother reason is that one of our long term life plans is to buy a large plot of land in the middle of nowhere. This would be fantastic for charging up solar batteries, and lighting up the area if needed, and it can be towed there.\n\nWhy a light tower over a regular generator?\n\nThese light towers can be be had for a very low price because there is so many of them out there, and it seems not a lot of people have really caught on that they are FANTASTIC portable generators. They are also easily moved without any special equipment. I did look at several other options, however they were either well outside of my price range for a backup to a backup, or they were near impossible to move without a forklift (Which, I don&apos;t have!) \nThe downside to these units is that they are reported to have very poor power quality. More on that later.\n\nWhat else did I look at?\n\nBefore we go over the light tower, lets look at what other options I considered. \nI did a lot of research and created a spreadsheet with everything I wanted out of a generator and came to a few different options. My general requirements were that i should be capable of running for extended periods of time, have a large fuel tank, have electric start and auto choke (Or, no choke) and be somewhat portable.\nIdeally I wanted something liquid cooled at 1800RPM.\nHere is the options I looked at, and why I didn&apos;t end up with either and other general thoughts\n\nHonda EU7000is\n\nThis is the easy option. They are very ",

      "body": "TL;DR? No.\nBack in February of 2024 I found a great deal on an APC AP7753 ATS PDU. These PDU&apos;s take 2 power inputs, and can switch between them like a UPS switches between grid and battery. Its a really cool device and I had high hopes it would take my already resilient power setup to the next level. Sadly, it appears that it may cause more problems than it solves in my setup. The upside is that I learned a lot about power, and these ATS devices. Despite all I have learned, there is still a lot to more to learn.\nThis specific PDU takes a 30a 120v input, which my APC SRT3000RMXLA has an output for. They have a built in network card, and a lot of 20a 120v outputs, perfect for my needs. If you read my old posts you will see that I make great use of my 3000VA double conversion UPS to power pretty much every piece of electronics in my house. Because of this, the UPS is a very large single point of failure, if the UPS drops the output, a lot of devices will get turned off. Its not life or death, but its not something I want to have to deal with. While the UPS is a very dependable device, with its own mechanisms to bypass faults and keep providing power, I wanted the ability to potentially completely replace the UPS in the future with zero downtime.\nRedundant PSU&apos;s in servers fix this issue, however not every device I have is capable of using redundant power supplies. Going forward I try to make sure every piece of equipment can, however for some things i am powering like a TV, its obviously not possible. \nWhen I got this PDU, I repurposed my old 2 regular PDU&apos;s and separated one for grid power, and one for UPS power. This lets me plug in redundant PSU devices without using up space and capacity on the ATS PDU. I also got some new power cords to better identify redundancy. Red means you cannot unplug it without the equipment powering off, and Blue means its going into a redundant PSU, so you can unplug if needed to organize them, etc.\nMy hope were that if I plug the ATS PDU Source A into my UPS, and Source B directly into house power, I would essentially never lose power to my devices.\nI plugged the PDU in to test, and sure enough I could freely switch between power inputs without dropping the load. Very cool! I did not realize at this point just how much nuance there is to these complex devices, but I went ahead and plugged A into the UPS and B into the grid.\nRight away I ran into an issue where it was complaining that Source A and Source B were unsynchronized. It had not occurred to me that the ATS is looking for power from A phase and B phase which it can synchronize, not just any 120v input. When I ran the power to my server closet, I paid no attention to the phasing of the power I brought in, and as it turns out, the secondary circuit I was using was on Phase A, which is the same as where the UPS is plugged into. \nWith some reconfiguration, I got the ATS fed by the UPS on phase A, and grid power from phase B. The ATS PDU was happy!\nIf the phases are not in sync, the ATS PDU cannot perform a seamless switch, and instead must perform a slower \"break-before-make transfer\" where there is a brief drop in power. Switching directly between 2 unsynced power sources could cause equipment damage which the PDU accounts for. \nOne day I tested the PDU fully loaded with my network equipment and switched the source with the selection button on the front, and sure enough, it switched from UPS power to grid power with a big kachunk, and everything stayed powered on. Very cool. I had assumed this project was over with, and I added it to the long backlog of things I should write a post about.\nThen, Hurricane Beryl hit Houston TX in July of 2024.\nAs soon as the wind picked up from the hurricane, the power to our entire neighborhood went out. Soon, power to the majority of the city would be out.\nMy 27kw liquid cooled backup generator fired right up, and in around 10 seconds the large generator ATS flipped, and we had power to the house again. The UPS&apos;s did their job and bridged the 10 second gap, and kept all network devices online without interruption. The APC ATS emailed me to say that Source B went offline, and then came back, just as expected. \nWe did not know at the time we would spend over 6 days running on generator power, while many in Houston would spend much longer without power, and without the luxury of power. \nWe have run on generator before, but never this long. The longest I&apos;ve had to date was 24 hours in the Derecho that hit Houston just a month and a half earlier. During this time, everything worked as expected. My generator started, the UPS&apos;s all worked fine, and of course the ATS PDU was just sat there doing nothing, because source A, the UPS power, is always up. Double conversion UPS&apos;s convert incoming AC power to DC, and then back to AC again. This means the power is always correct no matter the input, and there is no switchover time.\nHowever, this fact is assumes you fully ",

      "body": "2024 is not even over yet, but so we have already endured two massive storms that caused widespread destruction. This posts goes through the lessons I learned in the first of those 2 storms\n\n2024 Houston Derecho\n\nOn May 16th 2024, a Derecho hit the Houston area which had very strong winds and caused destruction and utility outages for large portions of the Houston and surrounding areas.\nPer the NWS, a Derecho is\nA derecho (pronounced similar to \"deh-REY-cho\") is a widespread, long-lived wind storm that is associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms. Although a derecho can produce destruction similar to the strength of tornadoes, the damage typically is directed in one direction along a relatively straight swath. As a result, the term \"straight-line wind damage\" sometimes is used to describe derecho damage. By definition, if the wind damage swath extends more than 240 miles (about 400 kilometers) and includes wind gusts of at least 58 mph (93 km/h) or greater along most of its length, then the event may be classified as a derecho.\n You can read more about the one that hit Houston in the Wikipedia article\nWe did not have any damage, however our utility power was out for over 24 hours (24 hours and 17 mins, to be exact). This was the first real test of my generator and other backup plans, and the worst wind storm I have experienced to date. \nOur power went out just as the storm rolled through, and that was really the only thing that happened to us. Our house sustained no damage, our fences were fine, our trees were fine and our internet stayed up. At the time of our power going out, the Utility Companies outage tracker showed over 1 millions customers without power, before the tracker itself got pulled offline. At this point we did not know how long we would be without power so we were expecting a long outage. In the end, it came back after just 24 hours, however large areas were without power for over a week. This, paired with extreme heat and humidity caused many people to seek refuge at family and friends houses or cooling centers. Many of those cooling centers did not have power. Explain how that works? It doesn&apos;t. 8 People in the greater Houston Area died as a result of this storm according to official figures at the time of writing this post.\nHere are all of the lessons learned during and after that storm. \n\n#1 - Backup Power - 100% worth it\n\nAfter I spent tens of thousands of dollars on a generator, many people told me I was crazy. This event solidified my opinion that if you live in the gulf coast area, and have the money and own a home, you should have some kind of backup power. Many High-tension transmission lines were knocked down, so the fact we just lost power for 24 hours was pure luck. There was every chance we could have lost power for weeks, or even longer in the brutal Houston heat, like many did. The fact that you have backup power not only means you don&apos;t have to endure the disaster and recovery without power, but it completely eliminates the anxiety before and after the storm, which I would argue has even greater value than just having power for 24 hours.\n\n#2 - Backup Power - Needs some refinement\n\nWhen the power went out, it was clearly the result of a tree hitting the line. The power went off, my generator came on and the ATS switched to generator power. However, then the grid power came back on for 20-30 seconds, which caused the ATS to flip back to grid power. But, then the power went of again, the ATS again flipped back to generator. This flipping back and forth is annoying, and I don&apos;t like it. I need to look for a solution to where once I am on generator power, I run on generator power for at least 20 or 30 minutes, to let whatever issues are at play, work themselves out.\n\n#3 - Weather Forecast - Lacking, or wrong\n\nThe weather forecast was completely wrong for this storm, and we never expected a strong storm. Many people were caught off guard or driving home when it hit. My lesson here is that I should just assume we are always going to be hit by a storm, and plan accordingly. Keep everything ready at all times. This storm caused hurricane levels of damage, but with no warning.\n\n#4 - Supplies - Keep them stocked\n\nThis ties in with the above point, that we will have no notice for a storm, so you better not need to run to the store for anything. When the Derecho hit, I just ran out of my favorite Deodorant. No running to the store to get some more! It wasn&apos;t really that much of a problem, as we were able to get to the store the next day, however I would like to be prepared for that. So, after that I ordered a 10 pack to rotate through, so I&apos;ll never run out again. I will apply this to just about everything, and keep a few spares of every consumable item I use so I am never in need during a disaster or shortage.\n\n#5 - Tools - Keep my Chainsaw sharp\n\nAt the time of the storm, my chainsaw was not sharp and I did not have the right files to s",

Its handy to just have compressed air on hand at any time, anywhere in the area of the garage. The hose itself on the DeWalt reel wasn&apos;t perfect, and in winter it would get quite stiff, but for the price it was great, and I figured I could just replace it later.\nWell, later happened. One day I went to unreel the hose while it was cold out, and in about 20 different places the hose split and leaked. \nWhile I do use it a few times a month, I&apos;m not using it day in and day out, and its not sat in the sun, so this is a pretty poor lifespan of the (Made in China) hose.\nSo, the only way forward is to replace the hose, easy right? Nope. I unreeled it and found that they attach the hose to the reel with a proprietary flare fitting!\nI tried my best to find this fitting and could not. I called DeWalt who told me they don&apos;t make the reel, and a company called MAT Holdings does. I called them, and they confirmed a few things\nThey don&apos;t know the name of the fitting\nThey don&apos;t sell new hoses\nThey won&apos;t replace the whole reel under warranty\nSo this pretty much means that unless you want to figure out a solution yourself, the DeWalt hose reel is a throw-away product. It should be expected that the hose would need to be replaced at some point.\nI figured I need to do something, so I ordered a (Made in USA) Goodyear rubber hose for $40\nThe best solution I could come up with was carefully cutting off the old fitting, and then using 1/2 PEX clamps which I had on hand to connect to the new hose\nI didn&apos;t know how much pressure it could take, so I didn&apos;t clamp them down all the way. I tested it at 120PSI, and no leaks.\nI put it back on the reel, and good as new! No thanks to DeWalt. This new rubber hose is MUCH better in the cold too.\nI also used this opportunity to support the inlet hose a bit better, with these nice rubber coated stainless pipe clamps I got for another project. Here is a link\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QPY499J/\nHere you can see where I put them, which protects the hose much better than my old solution of sharp metal strapping...\nMoral of the story, DeWalt does not stand behind their products.\n\nCrescent Bull Bar\n\nBut, a company that DOES stand behind their products is Crescent/APEX Tools. My view of Crescent is that its yet another American tool company that was bought by a big conglomerate so they could suck all the profit they could while decreasing quality, but I am wrong!\nYears and years ago I got a Bull Bar from Home Depot, it was this one\nI used it for EVERYTHING and removed about 10 concrete posts set in the ground. I pretty much abused it, and in the end, I ended up bending it right where the head meets the handle. I got my $60 worth out of it, so I just never thought much about it.\nBut one day when walking through Home Depot, I noticed they had the same Bull Bar, but with an updated design that looked less likely to bend, and I noticed it said it had a lifetime warranty\nSo, I emailed them telling them I had one and it bent. I never heard back, but about a week later a brand new one just showed up in the mail\nOverall, I am very pleased. I threw the old one in my truck just incase I ever get into a bind and it comes in handy.\n\nGarage Foundation Connection and Hurricane Ties\n\nBack in 2022 Houston, TX got an outbreak of tornados which destroyed many houses. A structural engineer I was working with assisted in the investigation of these homes. So, I asked him what low hanging fruit I could easily address in my house to protect from high winds, and 2 things came up. The connection of the rafters to the top plate of your house, and the connection between the bottom plate and the foundation.\nMy garage is completely unfinished, so I figured I would start there. I found that the in both areas, it was severely deficient.\nThe bottom plate was connected in just 4 places with duplex nails to the foundation\nI fixed this by using 1/2\" x 7\" concrete wedge anchors and 2x2 bearing plates 12\" from each corner and 48\" apart otherwise. \nHere is what I bought\n 1/2\" x 7\" concrete wedge anchors\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0711XRTQF/\nAnd some 2 x 2 bearing plates\nI tried using my M12 rotary hammer, but the concrete foundation was too hard, and I had to use my SDS-Max rotary hammer. I had to get creative in some areas to get to the bottom plate.\nFor attaching the top plate to the rafters, I found that installing traditional hurricane ties would be challenging and take a while. But then I found a product that I could use in place of them, and would take just 5 seconds to install\nThese screws are rated to be used in place of hurricane ties, and can installed in seconds with an impact driver\nWhen I got up to install them, I saw just how poorly ",

      "body": "At the end of last year we got an EV. This post details the install of an Emporia EVSE in my garage. It won&apos;t be very long, but it may give you an idea of how you might install yours.\nAt first I was just charging it with the included travel charger plugged into my welder receptacle. I found an NEMA 6-50P to 14-50R adapter so I could do this, but its not a permanent solution. The adapter was very good quality though\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09P1BP4ZQ/\nBut, I wanted a hard wired EVSE capable of charging at 11.5kw. There are a lot of choices out there though, and you need to decide if you want to truly hard wire the EVSE or use a NEMA 14-50. Watching this video though, it sold me on hard wiring.\nSomeone was actually kind enough to send me a free Emporia EV that they didn&apos;t use, brand new in the box! \nThe Emporia EVSE lacks local control which I would like, however you can control it via their app. I was having a very hard time finding an in stock EVSE that has full local control, so the Emporia was great for me, and free is the best price.\nRight away I went online to look at other installs, and I noticed some challenges. \nThere is no LEGAL way to have wires enter from the rear. If you drill a hole, you void the UL listing and violate code. Lots of people do this, but I wanted to avoid it as it is quite permanent. \nEven if you do, there is not enough room to properly get 6AWG THHN at a 90 degree angle into the connectors.\nPower comes in on the left, and can&apos;t be switched to the right side without voiding the UL listing and possibly having to strip more wire out of the VERY thick cord insulation (I didn&apos;t want to attempt this)\nThe pre-attached cord with a plug is VERY thick, meaning the hole is 1-1/4\". This is a very large size, and if you are hard wiring, probably too large meaning you will have to use reducing bushings or reducers for your conduit, or go with MASSIVE 1-1/4\" conduit which would be silly. a 3/4\" hole would have made much more sense for hard wiring, or at least 1\".\nMinor, but to remove the front you must remove 8 HEX screws from the REAR. Very tough! Not a big deal, but why not put them on the front?\nHere is an image, with the 1-1/4\" PVC fitting inserted. You can see there is a lack of space in this EVSE. No real way to coil up some spare wire for future serviceability. \nI am wiring this with THHN and conduit instead of Romex, as 6/3 Romex is only rated for 55a, not the full 60a. Anyone installing 6/3 Romex with a 60a breaker, is violating code.\nSo now I need to figure out the neatest and smartest way to get 3 x 6 AWG THHN conductors into this thing. I wanted the conduit in the wall, so I need a way to come out of the wall and into the bottom, all while being easy to install and service in the future. This EVSE will probably not be my \"Forever\" EVSE, as I&apos;m sure smarter ones will come out. For these reasons, I decided I needed to run the power inside the wall to a junction box of some kind, and then into the EVSE. This will allow me to easily bring the wire out of the wall, make the install easy and make swapping to a new EVSE in the future easy. \nFirst, I installed a new 60a breaker in the top spot to limit the distance to the main lugs. This installed in my 120a garage sub panel. \nHere is what I ended up with on initial install. I will detail everything as we go and show you the final product. \nFirst I mounted some 19/32 plywood to the studs. This plywood is thick enough that I can mount the EVSE and anything else, anywhere, with screws. No need to find a stud since the plywood is thick.\nThen, I ran 3/4\" Liquid Tight PVC Conduit in the wall from the panel containing 3 x THHN wires, into the back of a nice heavy duty lever disconnect. The reason for a disconnect is that it makes installing, changing and troubleshooting the EVSE very easy, I don&apos;t need to go all the way to the panel to flip the breaker. It also gets the cable out of the wall as a bonus. I chose one with lots of room inside, and hex lugs so I could easily tighten them to the proper, listed torque values.\nThe model I got was the Eaton DG322UGB and I do NOT recommend you purchase it. Not only because they didn&apos;t put the sticker on straight, but the main problem is that the lugs are aluminum, and you must be INCREDIBLY careful to not strip them while tightening to the listed torque values on the instructions. I actually stripped the middle lug which you may be able to see below, and thankfully was able to just swap it with the one next to it since this disconnect.\nThe reason the wires look a little bit messy is because I was going to re-terminate it after getting everything situated, but after struggling so much to not strip the lugs, I decided to leave it be. If I do it again, I will get one with STEEL lugs, or larger lugs overall. Either I got a dud, or no one installing these is using a torque wrench to validate. \nAlso yes, I know I&apos;m not allowed to re-identify 6AWG wire, it must b",
